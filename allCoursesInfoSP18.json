Emphasis is on tools to support search in massive biosequence databases and to perform fundamental comparison tasks such as DNA short-read alignment. These techniques are also of interest for more general string processing and for building and mining textual databases. Algorithms are presented rigorously, including proofs of correctness and running time where feasible. Topics include classical string matching, suffix array string indices, space-efficient string indices, rapid inexact matching by filtering (including BLAST and related tools), and multiple alignment. Students complete written assignments and implement advanced comparison algorithms to address problems in bioinformatics. This course does not require a biology background.

Topics covered include: Idea Assessment, Organization Formation, Capitalization, Growth, and Exit.  Corporate Entrepreneurship also will be explored.  This course integrates much of what you have learned in your core courses and challenges you to apply those learnings.  In each class you will be expected to make difficult business choices with less than perfect information, dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty, much like a real life entrepreneur.  Analytical rigor will be emphasized throughout and you will be expected to have \"run the numbers\" for each case.   \nA central element of this course is the opportunity to pitch your \"business idea\" to classmates via a 5 minute \"elevator pitch\".  Those with the winning business concepts will recruit classmates to join their team to conduct a comprehensive feasibility analysis. Your \"final\" will consist of a formal 20 minute dress presentation of your idea-much like you would pitch your business concept to a potential investor.  \n\nIt is the professors' objective that by the end of this course you will:\n1) Better understand entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial process\n2) Be an incisive analyst of a business and/or business concept\n3) Be a more persuasive seller of your business ideas.

However, innovation is risky and most new solutions fail in the marketplace. Thus, expertise in the development and marketing of new solutions is a critical skill for all managers. This course is about generating innovative opportunities and designing new solutions. The emphasis on solutions rather than the narrower products is intentional as this course is more about business innovation and somewhat less about new product design specifically; although new product design will be covered. In addition, while the course does overlap with entrepreneurship, the focus will be both on innovation in small and large companies. The follow-up course will focus more on how to mark an innovation once it is ready to go to market. It will focus on key business and marketing as summarized below:  \nBusiness Innovation: \n\u0007 Components of a successful innovation strategy and how to manage effectively\n\u0007 Approaches and frameworks for uncover unmet (and future) customer needs\n\u0007 Tools to focus on market-creation vs. market-competition\n\u0007 Tools and techniques for analyzing the validity and potential of new opportunities\n\u0007 How to forecast new product adoption and diffusion outcomes\n\u0007 How to manage the threat of disruptive innovation\n\u0007 How to design solutions that include functional, social, and emotional components\n\u0007 The attributes of great product and solution design\nMarketing Innovation:\n\u0007 Attributes of a successful product launch strategy\n\u0007 Customer segmentation and uncovering what \"causes\" those customers to buy\n\u0007 First mover advantages and disadvantages (when and how to enter new markets)\n\u0007 Matching innovations with the right monetization strategy\n\u0007 Concept and market testing\n\u0007 Experimentation methods for developing and launching new solutions (lean start-up)\n\u0007 Business model innovation and how to compete through business models\n\u0007 Innovative branding techniques\n\u0007 Data-driven marketing that integrates channels and personalizes the customer experience\nPrerequisite:  MKT 370.",

The challenges faced by Asians and Pacific Islanders in their Americanization pathway varied significantly not only from those of their European counterparts, but also from one another, making their experiences especially worthy of study.  Americans with Asian, Hawaiian, and Pacific Island heritage are at the core of a massive demographic and cultural shift that is profoundly reshaping the contours of American society today.  They remain the most diverse of all ethnic and racial groups, with Asian immigrants only enhancing this diversity.   \n\nThis multidisciplinary course will explore Asian and Pacific Island American experiences past and present, highlighting intersectional connections with social class, race, ethnicity, gender, and religion that forge identify formation and contribute to extensive social change. This intersection focuses on categories that privilege some Asian groups but put others at risk for social disadvantage.  We will be guided by sociological perspectives but draw heavily on sources from history, political science, social psychology, and Asian American studies, interweaving narratives that feature both similarities and differences among  Asian Americans, Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.  Capitalizing on  \"Asian\"  St. Louis as a fertile setting for our exploration,  we will welcome visitors from organizations representing  Asian American interests as they share perspectives on how Asian heritage  continues to define, circumscribe, or enhance opportunities for their constituencies.",

In many ways, St. Louis, Chicago, and New Orleans represent the major social and political forces that forged the modern American city. From westward expansion and the growth of the slave system, through mass European immigration and industrialization, the rise of Jim Crow and the decline of American industry, suburbanization, mass incarceration, and gentrification: all are visible in the landscapes of these American cities. Segregation of social groups, so often seen as natural or inevitable, is the result of historical processes, political decisions, public policies and individual actions. The course, in addition, will provide you with the opportunity to use some of the research techniques employed by urban scholars.

The intensity of U.S.-China partnership and rivalry can be discerned in a wide range of national and international events such as the colonial expansion and imperialist invasion in the 19th century, the nationalist movement and cultural modernization in the early 20th century, the Pacific War and the Cold War, the pro-democracy movement in China and the human rights debate, and China's economic reform and its rise as a global economic and political power in the 21st century. By drawing on scholarship in political and social history and area studies, this course analyzes both the historical context and contemporary developments of US-China relations. It helps students better understand the formation and transformation of Sino-American relations and its impacts on domestic, regional, and global history.",

This was one of the most tumultuous centuries in Chinese history, during which China faced threats from abroad in the form of Western and Japanese imperialism, and from within, in the form of environmental degradation and rebellions resulting in an unprecedented loss of human life. The nineteenth century has thus often been portrayed as a period of sharp decline for China. At the same time, we will explore the ways in which the origins of the dynamic society and economy found in China today, as well as the worldwide influence of overseas Chinese, can be traced to this century of turmoil.

The course will centralize the African American experience and the Black Freedom Movement in particular and will teach students how to contextualize media and critically assess its impact, and examine the various ways media has played pivotal roles in social movement. Using these skills we will answer the following questions: What is the audience for a particular form of media? When does a social movement become part of popular culture? What is the purpose of media in these situations? How effective has media been for organizing? An integral part to this course will be the use of the Henry Hampton Archive in the Washington University Film & Media Archive. The archive is a repository of primary materials that will be utilized throughout the semester. By using the Hampton Collection students will also learn to analyze and interpret primary documents while also having a more nuanced understanding of history and how media is constructed and informs the way we process socio-political currents that evolve into social movements.

Often marginalized in both the scholarship and popular memory, there exist a long unbroken chain of women who have organized around the principles of anti-sexism, anti-racism, and anti-capitalism. Frequently critical of heterosexist projects as well, these women have been the primary force driving the segment of the Black radical tradition that is commonly referred to as Black Feminism.  Remaining cognizant of the fact that Black Feminist thought has also flourished as an academic enterprise-complete with its own theoretical interventions (ie. standpoint theory, intersectionality, dissemblance, etc.) and competing scholarly agendas-this course will think through the project of Black Feminism as a social movement driven by activism and vigorous political action for social change. Focusing on grassroots efforts at organizing, movement building, consciousness raising, policy reform, and political mobilization, Feminist Fire will center Black Feminists who explicitly embraced a critical posture towards capitalism as an untenable social order. We will prioritize the life and thought of 20th century women like Claudia Jones, Queen Mother Audley Moore, Frances Beal, Barbara Smith, Audre Lorde, Angela Davis and organizations like the Combahee River Collective, Chicago's Black Women's Committee, and the Third World Women's Alliance. At its core, the course aims to bring the social movement history back into the discourse around Black Feminism.",

During the first half of the semester, we explore these historical relationships and examine the scientific constructs of race in the 19th and early 20th century. We touch on themes that defined the colonial encounter, including the development of the Four Communes in Senegal, the Negritude movement, and French Islamic policies in Africa. The curriculum for this course includes articles, films, and monographs, to explore these themes and includes writers and social activists living in France and the African diaspora. The second half of the course examines Francophone Africa after independence.  Here the course explores the political and cultural (inter) dependence between France and its Francophone African partners. In addition, we examine the challenges of many African states to respond to their citizen's needs, as well as France's changing immigration policies in the 1980s, followed by the devaluation of the West and Central African Franc (CFA).",

An inexhaustible public witness and the author of plays, essays, novels, and short stories, the Harlem-born Baldwin ranks with the most daring and eloquent American voices of the twentieth century. His first novel, the autobiographical \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" (1953), wrestled with the heritage of black Christianity and black social realism. His second novel, \"Giovanni's Room\" (1956), set in Paris and peopled with non-black characters, explored the complexity of same-sex desire years before the Stonewall riots announced the gay rights movement. \"Notes of a Native Son\" (1955), the first collection of Baldwin's lush and searching essays, is perhaps the most-tweeted book of our era and is listed among the Modern Library's top twenty nonfiction books of the twentieth century.  Our reading list will contain all of these books, but we'll also begin with Richard Wright's novel \"Native Son\" (1940), the young Baldwin's defining aesthetic enemy, and end with Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir \"Between the World and Me\" (2015), the prize-winning Baldwin rewrite that illuminates the older author's elevated reputation in the wake of Black Lives Matter.

        "description": "This course will examine the social construction of deviance as it relates to blackness in the U.S. context, with specific emphasis on the impact it has had on how black people make, claim, and belong to home. Here, I am referring to home not only in terms of the built environment (house) but also in terms of legal citizenship and cultural inclusion. There has been, and continues to be, a long history of racial minorities searching for and being denied home in geopolitical spaces that often articulate them as outside of home-as, in fact, homeless-literally and figuratively. This is evidenced by the constant displacement of black people through processes of gentrification; the overrepresentation of black people in carceral institutions; the racialized nature of the housing mortgage crisis; the alarming numbers of little black girls across the country who have gone missing without much public outcry or media coverage; and in the murdering of black trans women. And yet, racial minorities and black people in particular have simultaneously insisted on building and claiming home in the U.S., despite attempts to keep them out. This course will help frame these historical tensions and the subsequent processes contributing to these tensions as they relate to gender, sexuality, class and the nation. Particularly, we will be engaging popular representation and media, the law, and social and public policy to better understand who gets understood as deviant or normal, why, and what (im)material implications such cultural designations have on people's lives. In doing so, we will also examine how black people in the U.S. have mobilized the discourse of deviance as well as acts of deviance themselves, as modes of resistance, to both respond to and sometimes perpetuate systems of oppression organized around the banner of normativity. As such, student will develop a richer understanding of how the bad (re: deviant) and boujee (re: bourgeoisie) life, while seemingly at odds, are generative sites of social, political, and economic possibility. Key topics we will cover: black feminist thought and queer of color critique; blackness, respectability and the rise of capitalism; biopower, surveillance, and cercerality; and urban renewal and scenes/modes of resistance.",

Lastly, we will take a closer look at several of his most influential views and concepts, including the talented tenth, double consciousness, the veil, and the psychological wages of race. In this, we will also consider his disagreement and rivalry with Booker T.

Batman; play Arkham City on Playstation; watch the Badman parody by Pete Holmes; send a meme with Batman slapping Robin; take pictures of a Batfamily group cosplay at a comicon; read a Prezi Batman visual essay; or on Halloween give Batman candy to a Batkid.  These representations (or, images) of Batman illustrate appropriation at play in our multilayered visual culture-any of them could be reiterated, interrogated, or discussed further in the cultural production of the visual and most of them are not official or controlled by DC Comics, the owner of Batman.  Viewing and understanding these images of Batman-or any other iconic figure of American popular or political culture-requires visual literacy. We encounter and interact with the most immersive, compelling, and culturally relevant texts-whether stories, memes, concepts, characters, personalities-through visual means and visualizing is central to cultural production and consumption today; therefore, visual literacy is a necessary part of cultural education and understanding. This course takes a visual literacy approach-learning how to read different kinds of visual texts across a series of axes (static/moving, isolated/contextual, displayed/encountered, original/copied/transformed)-while placing those media within a larger context of cultural analysis as part of American Culture Studies and across a range of disciplines-cinema studies, literary analysis, art history and criticism -to learn how meaning is constructed visually.

        "description": "Organized athletics are an influential part of American culture, and have been for more than 130 years. In many ways, the rise of sporting cultures in the United States reflected a similar process of modernizing and commercializing physical contests that took place around the world. In one significant way it did not: American athletics were built into, and made inextricable from, the foundations of the nation's university system. As such, these high profile games were constructed upon the ideals of \"amateurism,\" a term with significant ramifications for the ostensible objectives of the athletes playing college sports and the administrators organizing them. Since the early 20th century, these ideals have been largely overseen by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (or NCAA), an organization that has also transformed the games of its member institutions into a multibillion dollar industry. This has resulted in soaring profits for participating universities and, critics have argued, an attendant abdication on the part of many universities of their responsibility to provide all of their students (athletes and otherwise) with meaningful educational experiences.\n\nThis course traces the history and culture of sports in the American university from the 1880s to the present, and asks: What are the benefits of big time sports on campus? What are the drawbacks? What are the ramifications for American culture, broadly construed? What are the consequences for our educational institutions and the culture of higher learning? How does the continued prominence and influence of the NCAA affect the way we understand what sports are, and can be? How are students and athletes themselves affected, for good or ill? How are matters of gender, race, and sexuality affected by sporting cultures on campus? What future might we imagine for sport in the university?",

        "description": "From the great \"sores\" on the body politic described by Thomas Jefferson to the struggles over \"blight\" and gentrification of the modern era, the city has always served as a place that has intrigued, overwhelmed and at times repulsed Americans. This course is a history of the sensory landscape of the American city-how it looked, smelled, sounded, tasted and felt-and the deeper meanings Americans have invested within it. We will explore the laden social meaning of terms like \"filth,\" \"darkness\" and \"slum\"-as well as their antonyms in \"sunlight,\" \"health\" and \"home\"-and how they influenced the ways in which Americans not only perceived the city but sought to understand, master and, at times, reimagine it. Sensory perceptions of city life, we will find, were deeply connected to emerging ideas about race, class and gender. Moreover, the senses have always played a key role in working out larger questions of urbanism and urban form: What is the role of the city in American life? Is it a social problem or a place of opportunity and liberation? How have Americans responded to and sought to impose order on the ever-changing-and at times chaotic-urban landscape? \n\nStudents will be introduced to a wide array of primary sources through course readings, ranging from government documents to first-hand accounts of reformers to maps, images and literature. While touching a broad array of subjects, readings will center on discourses of health, disease, and sanitary reform, in large part because of their intimate connection with evolving sensory perceptions of the city. Assignments will consist of two primary source analyses and a final paper focusing on a research question of the student's choosing, which will be formulated in consultation with the instructor over the course of the semester.",

        "description": "Whether Hollywood representations of Civil War politics in Lincoln, documentary reconstruction of the civil rights movement in Eyes on the Prize, or modern day news coverage of the Ferguson protests through Internet and social media, our understanding of history and culture are always mediated by the presence of storytelling techniques. This exploration-based workshop considers how media makers reconstruct historical people, places, and events using different media-based storytelling techniques. Through criticism and analysis of various media artifacts (e.g., documentary and narrative film, podcasts, and online/gallery exhibits), we seek to understand issues like the effects of manipulating historical facts to enhance a story, the ethics of portraying a person's life on screen, and the challenges of representing contesting voices within a narrative framework. We consider the broader political, social, and cultural ramifications wrought when media makers, intentionally or not, misrepresent people, movements, issues, ideas, and events. Students visit local historical archives such as the W.U. Film & Media Archive to examine primary source materials and to learn how they are utilized in the narrative construction of media projects. In addition they are trained in basic archival research, interview, and oral history techniques. Throughout the semester, students actively create media projects that synthesize their class learning into a final short film, documentary, podcast, exhibit, or other form that engages in, or actively critiques, historical narrative construction. Final projects will be created with regular consultation of the instructor. **Note: Technology and equipment needed for a particular final project may not be available through the course. It is best for students to be able to provide their own equipment for their project of choice, such as basic editing software (Moviemaker or iMovie), camera (consumer grade or even cell phone cameras will suffice), or whatever else a project might need. Media production knowledge is not a prerequisite for taking this course.",

This course will explore and analyze how media, broadly defined, including (but not limited to) music, art, film, literature, television and social media, has influenced social movements in very profound ways over the last century. The course will centralize the African American experience and the Black Freedom Movement in particular and will teach students how to contextualize media and critically assess its impact, and examine the various ways media has played pivotal roles in social movement. Using these skills we will answer the following questions: What is the audience for a particular form of media? When does a social movement become part of popular culture? What is the purpose of media in these situations? How effective has media been for organizing? An integral part to this course will be the use of the Henry Hampton Archive in the Washington University Film & Media Archive. The archive is a repository of primary materials that will be utilized throughout the semester. By using the Hampton Collection students will also learn to analyze and interpret primary documents while also having a more nuanced understanding of history and how media is constructed and informs the way we process socio-political currents that evolve into social movements.

        "description": "America has often been celebrated as \"a nation of immigrants\" - a narrative that commonly emphasizes earlier pathways of Western European heritage rather than later pathways of Asians, and largely overlooks the experiences of colonized, indigenous people such as Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians.  The challenges faced by Asians and Pacific Islanders in their Americanization pathway varied significantly not only from those of their European counterparts, but also from one another, making their experiences especially worthy of study.  Americans with Asian, Hawaiian, and Pacific Island heritage are at the core of a massive demographic and cultural shift that is profoundly reshaping the contours of American society today.  They remain the most diverse of all ethnic and racial groups, with Asian immigrants only enhancing this diversity.   \n\nThis multidisciplinary course will explore Asian and Pacific Island American experiences past and present, highlighting intersectional connections with social class, race, ethnicity, gender, and religion that forge identify formation and contribute to extensive social change. This intersection focuses on categories that privilege some Asian groups but put others at risk for social disadvantage.  We will be guided by sociological perspectives but draw heavily on sources from history, political science, social psychology, and Asian American studies, interweaving narratives that feature both similarities and differences among  Asian Americans, Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.  Capitalizing on  \"Asian\"  St. Louis as a fertile setting for our exploration,  we will welcome visitors from organizations representing  Asian American interests as they share perspectives on how Asian heritage  continues to define, circumscribe, or enhance opportunities for their constituencies.",

        "description": "American culture is so often defined by its obsessive attachment to material things - the iPhones, coffee cups, favorite t-shirts and Harley-Davidson motorcycles that fill our everyday lives.  This course will explore our contradictory relationship to such objects - the possessions that serve practical functions and give us a sense of identity, meaning and power, but just as often come to possess or control us.  How do things take hold of us?  What gives them potency, value, and cultural significance?  What psychological, social, economic and political purposes do they serve?  Do Americans have a distinct relationship (or a dysfunctional attachment) to their possessions?  In answering such questions, we will consider objects of all kinds, from the mundane and utilitarian to the strange, rare and often-fetishized.  We will explore their histories, their participation in regimes of commodification and power, their everyday and symbolic functions - in short, the twists and turns of their rich cultural lives.  The course will introduce different strategies for interpreting objects as cultural evidence, drawing upon work in anthropology, art history, sociology, literature and museum studies, as well as theorists (Marx, Freud, Baudrillard, and others) who have influenced modern conceptions of material life.  Students should also look forward to some in-the-field analysis of different historic, museum, and personal objects around St. Louis (field trips!).

Recent political events and social conflicts highlight deep divisions in American society, raising critical questions about the media and objectivity (e.g., alternative facts and 'fake' news), networks and segregation (e.g., who talks to whom), who gets to decide what is viewed as `truth,' and the role of researchers and academia in combating (or contributing to) misinformation. This course explores these questions with a sociological lens. We will use foundational sociological theories to learn how to recognize the existence of multiple realities, and consider the implications of social constructionism for key domains of everyday life, American politics, and the production of knowledge.

Often marginalized in both the scholarship and popular memory, there exist a long unbroken chain of women who have organized around the principles of anti-sexism, anti-racism, and anti-capitalism. Frequently critical of heterosexist projects as well, these women have been the primary force driving the segment of the Black radical tradition that is commonly referred to as Black Feminism.  Remaining cognizant of the fact that Black Feminist thought has also flourished as an academic enterprise-complete with its own theoretical interventions (ie. standpoint theory, intersectionality, dissemblance, etc.) and competing scholarly agendas-this course will think through the project of Black Feminism as a social movement driven by activism and vigorous political action for social change. Focusing on grassroots efforts at organizing, movement building, consciousness raising, policy reform, and political mobilization, Feminist Fire will center Black Feminists who explicitly embraced a critical posture towards capitalism as an untenable social order. We will prioritize the life and thought of 20th century women like Claudia Jones, Queen Mother Audley Moore, Frances Beal, Barbara Smith, Audre Lorde, Angela Davis and organizations like the Combahee River Collective, Chicago's Black Women's Committee, and the Third World Women's Alliance. At its core, the course aims to bring the social movement history back into the discourse around Black Feminism.",

        "description": "As with all newly emergent technologies, the early automobile rallied enthusiasts and detractors alike, spurring heated debates about class and labor and the role technology has-and should have-in an industrial society. Much like the factory, automobiles became the locus of political, economic, and social conflict, particularly in urban settings where the competing narratives of progress and degradation were especially evident. In this multidisciplinary course we'll examine such debates up close, and develop a working model for studying the relationship of technology and culture that complicates popular understandings of technological innovation, change, and social impact. Part of our study will focus on the mechanical and engineering principles of the early-era automobile itself by means of 3D image-modeling, engineering schematics, and instruction manuals to develop an understanding of 'how it works.' Another part will focus on reading primary documents like magazines, newspapers, etiquette manuals, print advertisements (available from WUSTL's Modern Graphic History Library) and other popular publications of the late 19th and early 20th centuries to broaden our historical understanding of cultural perceptions of the automobile, of factories, and of technology in general. Grounding these examinations will be scholarly readings in history and history of technology, sociology of technology, philosophy, and cultural study. Students will develop final projects that explore the many ways that the automobile-as a site of contested narratives, cultural values and ideologies-shaped the broader social, political, and civic culture of the urban landscape. NOTE: no experience in auto mechanics or engineering required! This is a humanities-based study of technology, and while past experience studying culture is helpful, this too is not a pre-requisite.",

If home ownership is such a central part of American identity, why have so many generations of Americans struggled to achieve it?\n\nIn this course, we explore the histories of different versions of home and homeownership by touching down in different locations at pivotal moments in order to investigate the varied meanings of housing and homeownership in the context of a particular place and time in American history.  Using a case-study approach, the course travels across time and space to explore diverse forms of housing, including the following: the big house and slave house in the south under slavery, the immigrant tenement in New York City, the company town in south Chicago, the Midwest homestead, the planned postwar suburban neighborhood, high rise public housing and gated communities.  This format exposes students to the important role of federal and local policies as well as themes of housing including: homes as private and domestic realms; housing as a commodity and the largest form of American debt; housing as an icon and encoder of social status; housing as exclusionary and inclusionary; housing as racial or socio-economic discrimination; the suburbs and their discontents; and the recent housing crisis.

        "description": "This inter-disciplinary course is designed to introduce you to the history of three of America's major cities. We will explore the political, social, and cultural histories of each of these cities while tracing changes in architecture and the built environment. We chose these three cities for their diverse and intersecting histories. In many ways, St. Louis, Chicago, and New Orleans represent the major social and political forces that forged the modern American city. From westward expansion and the growth of the slave system, through mass European immigration and industrialization, the rise of Jim Crow and the decline of American industry, suburbanization, mass incarceration, and gentrification: all are visible in the landscapes of these American cities. Segregation of social groups, so often seen as natural or inevitable, is the result of historical processes, political decisions, public policies and individual actions. The course, in addition, will provide you with the opportunity to use some of the research techniques employed by urban scholars. We will engage in a major research project, tracing the history of St. Louis through a variety of primary sources. Our aim will be to trace the historical processes that generated urban landscapes divided along lines of race, class, ethnicity or religion.",

        "description": "Tyrion Lannister, \"Crazy Eyes\" Suzanne Warren, Sheldon Cooper, \"American Horror Story: Freakshow\" and \"Asylum,\" \"The Fault in Our Stars\"-many of our cultural touchstones in recent years feature disabled characters or concerns. How did we get to this point in disability representation, and is where we are now any different from even a few decades ago: when disability marked childhood boogeymen like Scar or Voldemort and the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act became law? Historically, authors have represented characters who mentally and physically deviate from cultural standards of \"normal\" functioning or appearance. These textual strategies have coalesced around common tropes of disability representation-the malformed villain, the pitiful sick victim, the \"supercrip.\" In our course we will question these common categories as well as consider the proliferation of new ways of imagining disability: Who gets to belong? Who possesses a body that matters? How does disability representation affect everyday understandings of disability? Exploring 20th-century texts, we will discuss disability as a minority identity, one both bodily and socially constructed. We will also consider disability not as an isolated condition but as one affected by sexuality, race, gender, and nationality. Potential texts include Mark Haddon's \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\" Sylvia Plath's \"The Bell Jar,\" Audre Lorde's \"The Cancer Journals,\" and Frances Hodgson Burnett's \"The Secret Garden.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

We must work to lift people who are underserved; we must expand the range of abilities for those who are caught in only one kind of training; and we must each learn to be creative thinkers contributing our abilities to many sectors of our society.   In this course, we expand our views about learning by experimenting with the creative process of lateral thinking.  In the first six weeks of the semester, we learn about learning by meeting with exceptional people with many scholarly, professional, and civic engagement accomplishments.  We also learn by working in teams to develop an exciting set of 2-D / 3-D, hands-on, problem-solving workshops for middle-schoolers from economically disadvantaged urban families; the workshop curriculum is be based upon your knowledge and passion as well as your interests. During the last eight weeks, we deliver these workshops once a week to students at Compton-Drew Middle School (adjacent to the Science Center in the city of St. Louis).  In this course we celebrate the choices of studies we each pursue, and expand our experience by learning from each other's knowledge bases and creativity.  The course is offered each Fall and Spring semester, and is open to students from all disciplines, schools, freshmen through seniors, and meets the Multidisciplinary Fieldwork requirement for AMCS majors.  **Attendance Mandatory for the first week of Classes.**  NOTE: On class days scheduled for the middle school, students must account for transportation time between WU and Compton-Drew so plan accordingly to ensure arrival by 1pm.\n\nTo meet compliance with University Policies on Minors, all students participating in this class will be required to undergo a fingerprinting background check, which is done on campus, prior to interacting with the Compton-Drew students.

Why have so many novels and films memorialized adolescence? How has the period of development been portrayed in recent American fiction? How have depictions and attitudes toward teen culture changed over the past fifty years? We will begin with J.D. Salinger's classic novel of adolescence alienation, \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" a book that in many ways helped initiate the rise of the youth movement in the 1950s and 60s. From there, we will read a series of novels and historical studies that will trace the changes in teen culture that have occurred over the past half century. Our class will also consider a few films, such as \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and \"Dazed and Confused,\" which have helped shape our conception of the American teenager. Ultimately, we will question what these depictions of teen culture can tell us about larger trends and concerns in American life.

An inexhaustible public witness and the author of plays, essays, novels, and short stories, the Harlem-born Baldwin ranks with the most daring and eloquent American voices of the twentieth century. His first novel, the autobiographical \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" (1953), wrestled with the heritage of black Christianity and black social realism. His second novel, \"Giovanni's Room\" (1956), set in Paris and peopled with non-black characters, explored the complexity of same-sex desire years before the Stonewall riots announced the gay rights movement. \"Notes of a Native Son\" (1955), the first collection of Baldwin's lush and searching essays, is perhaps the most-tweeted book of our era and is listed among the Modern Library's top twenty nonfiction books of the twentieth century.  Our reading list will contain all of these books, but we'll also begin with Richard Wright's novel \"Native Son\" (1940), the young Baldwin's defining aesthetic enemy, and end with Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir \"Between the World and Me\" (2015), the prize-winning Baldwin rewrite that illuminates the older author's elevated reputation in the wake of Black Lives Matter.

Film style and form do not constitute the major focus of this course, but we will approach a number of films with attention to style and form in order to understand how cultural, economic, industrial, aesthetic, and technological determinants have impacted American filmmaking as a blend of art and commerce.  By the end of this course, you will have a detailed knowledge of the history of American cinema, the individuals and institutional processes that have shaped it, the most important challenges and milestones that have marked it, and the aesthetic forms and socio-cultural effects that have been attributed to it.

Through case studies at home and abroad, we examine how cultural, environmental, economic, and geopolitical processes are entangled with changing patterns of energy-related resource extraction, production, distribution, and use.  America's changing position as global consumer and dreamer is linked to increasingly violent contests over energy abroad while our fuel-dependent dreams of boundless (oil) power give way to uncertainties and new possibilities of nation, nature, and the future. Assuming that technology and markets alone will not save us, what might a culturally, politically, and socially-minded inquiry contribute to understanding the past and future of global energy and the American dream?",

Building on a recent explosion of historical studies of American feminism, this course examines the history of the so-called \"second wave\" of the women's movement from its origins in the early 1960s to its alleged demise in the late 1980s.  Topics to be covered include the origins of feminist activism; the traditional history of the women's movement and recent revisions; how race and class shaped the feminist movement; how feminist ideas and organizing transformed American society; feminism and individual experience; and responses to the women's movement.  In this discussion-based course, we read scholarly analyses of the women's movement as well as memoirs, popular essays, and many primary documents from the period.",

        "description": "Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students from all academic disciplines (and with any post-graduate plan) to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police. \n\n\nPrerequisite: sophomore standing or higher; preference given to upper-level students on the waitlist.

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (or women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

The fiction writers of this period, keen to capture the spirit of the age, helped to create the enduring idea that consumerism and an orientation toward material acquisition are at the heart of gendered concepts of American identity. Their stories documented, and sometimes celebrated, the emergence of recognizable \"types\" of American womanhood and manhood-such as self-made millionaires, ambitious \"working girls,\" bargain-hunting middle-class housewives, and the commercially minded women and men of the social and intellectual elite. At the same time, their stories articulated anxieties about U.S. consumer culture and its impact on the world. Students in this course will read, discuss, and write about novels and short stories by writers such as Henry James, Mary Wilkins Freeman, Kate Chopin, Theodore Dreiser, Edith Wharton, Nella Larsen, Langston Hughes, and F.

While he wrote a number of masterpieces (The Glass Menagerie, A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof), he also wrote many plays which remain virtually unknown, but which are worthy of renewed exploration. The playwright's tortured and self-destructive life and mysterious death (including his addiction to drugs and alcohol) hold a mirror up to American culture, especially with regard to the writer's first closeted, then flamboyantly gay life-style. This seminar offers an opportunity to examine this brilliant, flawed, and obsessive writer in depth.

This course will explore the range of cultural responses to the new 20th century city up to World War II. The American city was seen as both an incubator of difference, and of mass conformity and manipulation; a dynamic space in which to form fluid networks that catalyzed new forms of creativity, and a place of strangers and social alienation. We will trace the history of these polarized responses in the 20th century arts and literature of the city, looking at the vibrant popular culture of film, vaudeville, and cross-dressing; new aesthetic forms such as collage and expressionism; and new urban subjects.

In developing the portfolio students create a record of their growth in the major: they bring together materials that represent their learning and reflect on how they have realized, and moved beyond, priorities they set for themselves. Students also consider how they can apply their learning in AMCS to post-college endeavors. Translating research findings for a public audience is an important component of the major experience, and an aspect of the portfolio work. In the workshop students produce a presentation of their capstone project for the AMCS Spring Colloquium. They also have the chance to explore venues for a wider audience, beyond the colloquium (e.g., publication, digital presence). Activities include written reflections, peer feedback on presentations, and discussion with guests from the AMCS community, including faculty and alums.

        "description": "This course explores the philosophical debates and performed enactments of nonviolent direct action during the so-called \"classical phase\" of the civil rights movement (1954-1965). In order to understand the stakes of the philosophical and organizational debates that emerged during that time, we will begin with a study of important antecedents in transnational pacifist movements, women's suffrage, the interracial sit-down strikes of the 1930s, and the Indian independence movement. We will explore some of the questions that occupied mid-century activists: is nonviolence an internal philosophical or theological position that all protestors must embrace with sincerity? Or is it a theatrical tactic designed for the benefit of television audiences? Does the repetition of nonviolence risk diluting its power? How can ordinary people be encouraged to overcome their \"conditioned reflex\" to violence? We will ask: how do aesthetic considerations of choreographies of passivity-stillness, pliability, falling, going limp, being carried away-inform the \"doing nothing\" of nonviolence? How are such techniques learned and taught, and how did the emerging fields of sociodrama and psychodrama inform the rehearsals for confrontation with the state? Finally, we will consider the future of nonviolence in a Trump presidency. If, as Richard Gregg argued in the 1930s, nonviolent noncooperation in India was effective largely because it engendered \"surprise, curiosity, and wonder\" on the part of military opposition and onlookers, what new approaches are needed now that nonviolent direct action has become part of the anticipated playbook of protest?

Gender identities or presentations that run counter to these conventions are frequently identified as disordered and in need of fixing.  In this course, we will take up these issues through three fundamental themes:  the social and cultural (re)production of gendered bodies and dispositions; the normalization of these productions and the subsequent location of \"madness\" in divergent or dissonant experiences of embodiment; and the situation of discourses of \"madness\" within debates of resistance and conformity, selfhood and agency.",

Although archaeology is often treated as an historical science, the nature of the material record does provide an opportunity to use experimentation as an important way of interpreting what we excavate.  The class will be working with the most tangible materials recovered from archaeological contexts, that is stone and pottery.  After reviewing the history of experimentation in archaeological investigations we will turn to the material record.  This will be followed in our initial weeks of setting up the experiments and how they will be used to compare with available data sets derived from archaeological contexts.  As part of the class we will take several field trips to areas where materials exist in a natural setting.  Each class member will select a specific material for the focus of their experiments. In the end students will produce several experiments using different materials, document their experiments in written reports, and finally present their results to the class for discussion and evaluation.",

In this course, we begin with observation, learning tools to observe and document urban life. Readings cover ethnographic methods and also include classic and contemporary urban ethnographies that consider the city in conversation with issues of race, inequality, and identity such as poverty, segregation, processes of displacement, gentrification, neoliberalism, and cultural and expressive practices. The course also includes several fieldtrips to observe sites of culture in St. Louis such as Euclid Ave., Cherokee Street, and the Missouri History Museum, as well as the DUC and sites on campus. Throughout the course, students will practice ethnographic methods (including observation, writing field notes, conducting interviews, and documenting sights and sounds) to produce an ethnographic research project about a site of culture in St. Louis.

        "description": "For centuries, Indians, Chinese, Jews, Malays, Arabs, Portuguese, Africans, Americans, English and a fascinating medley of other peoples have been circulating freely in the Indian Ocean as merchants, pirates, explorers, missionaries and pilgrims. From the Horn of Africa to Indonesia, the Indian Ocean has long witnessed a frantic exchange that cut across ethnic and language affiliations. We begin by exploring the early history of the Indian Ocean up till the 18th century. We then trace the spread of Islam in the region which has been dubbed the 'Muslim Lake.' Next, we focus on the consequences of increased European presence in the Indian Ocean from the late 18th century onwards. What effects did European imperial expansion have on Indian Ocean trade, migration patterns and the religious haj pilgrimage? Vivid travel narratives provided by Joseph Conrad and Amitav Ghosh challenge historical periodization that neatly divides world history into pre-colonial and colonial eras. During the 19th century, both Europeans and Asians, traders, migrants and haj pilgrims alike, travelled extensively across the Indian Ocean as before, albeit at a faster rate and in much greater numbers. This period coincided with the intensification of Indian and Arab migration to Southeast Asia. How did the advent of colonialism accompanied by immense technological development in the 19th century actually affect the political and economic relations in the Indian Ocean? We round off the semester with sections of Robert Kaplan's seminal book on contemporary politics in the Indian Ocean. How relevant is Islam during the 21st century?",

While these issues are obviously part of contemporary conflicts, these situations are clearly more complex. It is the goal of this course to look at and unpack contemporary and recent conflicts around the continent to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the processes leading to large-scale conflict, to crisis management in these circumstances, and to the small and large-scale processes of peace-building and community rebuilding efforts.

But in the contemporary era of neoliberalism and big-data, social scientists are increasingly examining their ethical duty to their informants-specifically, concerns about maintaining neutrality versus leveraging ethnographic data to improve lives or to make a profit.  We will begin with the history of this ethical debate and move into contemporary issues in anthropology for social change and in business anthropology.  Topics will include multidisciplinary teamwork, practitioner capacity building, community action programming, policy development and ethical design.  This course is designed for upper-level anthropology students but will be particularly useful for those considering combining anthropology as a double-major or minor in a range of applied fields (business, engineering, social work, law, health and medicine).

After reviewing the history of experimentation in archaeological investigations we will turn to the material record.  This will be followed in our initial weeks of setting up the experiments and how they will be used to compare with available data sets derived from archaeological contexts.  As part of the class we will take several field trips to areas where materials exist in a natural setting.  Each class member will select a specific material for the focus of their experiments.

The focus of the course is the unique trajectory of civilization that is made evident in the region of Central Eurasia from roughly 6000 BC to the historical era (ca. AD 250).  In addition to this ancient focus, the course aims to relate many of the most historically durable characteristics of the region to contemporary developments of the past two or three centuries.  Fundamentally, this course asks us to reconceptualize the notion of \"civilization\" from the perspective of societies whose dominant forms of organization defied typical classifications such as \"states\" or \"empires\" and, instead, shaped a wholly different social order over the past 5000 years or more.  This class provides a well-rounded experience of the geography, social organization, and social interconnections of one of the most essential and pivotal regions in world history and contemporary political discourse.",

Roman art, by contrast, has been seen as derivative and secondary; Johann Joachim Wincklemann, the founder of modern art history, classified it among the \"style of the imitators.\" But this traditional dichotomy rests in large part on the Romans' own reactions to their encounters with the arts of Greece.  Through the analysis of textual sources, architecture, statuary and painting, this course will investigate the status and influence of Greek art in the city of Rome from the third-century BCE until the late Imperial period, and will seek to understand how Roman responses to and uses of Greek art have come to shape the modern perception of both traditions.

And while the \"digital humanities\" are now widely embraced, the definition of the field remains mutable and even contested.  Is it practical, theoretical, or a combination of approaches and methodologies? This course operates under the premise that what constitutes digital art history is less about rigid interpretations and practices, and more about creating a technologically astute and nimble professional capable of \"learning to learn\" technologies as they emerge; determining when and how a technology may be useful in research, instruction, and other professional work; and understanding how to effectively apply technology in a broad range of contexts. \"The Digital Art Historian\" will emphasize experiential learning though the use of digital tools and analysis of a range of digital projects, grounded in a rubric of critical reflection. By the end of the course, students will have a significantly more thorough understanding of how to be an art historian in an increasingly digital world. Meets for 8 sessions, typically held every other week. Prereq: Graduate standing in Art History and Archaeology Dept.",

For example, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has proved to be an invaluable tool in both efforts to determine the atomic structure of proteins and small molecules as well as in clinical settings. This course introduces students to a variety of cutting-edge laboratory techniques and discusses the impact of these techniques on biology and medicine. Students have the unique opportunity to learn from graduate students employing these approaches in their doctoral studies. Topics include: human brain neuroimaging, next-generation DNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas gene editing and many more. Weekly classes consist of a 30-45 minute presentation on a particular technique, followed by 60-minute discussion of the assigned readings. Students will be evaluated on class participation, answers to weekly research based questions and two longer written assignments. Prerequisites: Biology 2960 and 2970 and at least one semester of BIO500 or equivalent research experience approved by the course master.",

This semester there are also a number of presentations by job candidates. The point of these seminars is to learn about exciting research. What questions are they asking? What are they discovering? What new scientific stories can we hear about ecology or evolution? What makes up these fields anyway? The seminars are often followed by receptions which are a chance to get to know each other better and to ask questions.\nThis course invites undergraduates to listen to these presentations and write about them. After all, this is a major part of the ideas climate at Wash U. It would be a great idea to get in the habit of going to seminars, with this course, or without. \nIn addition to attending seminars, we will meet three times during the semester, early on and a couple of times later.\nWhen: Most seminars are 4:00 on Thursdays, though some are on other days.

Throughout the course of the semester, each student will develop a research plan in their chosen area of interest.  The plan will be developed in consultation with at least two faculty members (from at least two different subdisciplines within the pathway) as well as the other students and faculty participating in the course.  The culmination of this course will be for each student to produce an NIH-style grant proposal on the research project of their choosing.  For most students, this will serve either as their thesis proposal or a solid precursor to the thesis proposal. The course will be designed to help facilitate the development of such a research plan through didactic work, class presentations, class discussion, and constructive feedback on written work.  The course will begin with a review of written examples of outstanding research proposals, primarily in the form of grant submissions similar to those that the students are expected to develop (i.e., NRSA style proposals, R03 proposals).  Review of these proposals will serve as a stimulus to promote discussion about the critical elements of good research proposals and designs in different areas. Each student will be expected to give three presentations throughout the semester that will provide opportunities to receive constructive feedback on the development and implementation of research aims.  The first presentation (towards the beginning of the semester) will involve presentation of the student's general topic of interest and preliminary formulation of research questions.  Feedback will emphasize ways to focus and develop the research hypotheses into well-formulated questions and experiments.  The second presentation will involve a more detailed presentation of specific research questions (along the lines of NIH-style Specific Aims) and an initial outline of research methods.  The final presentation will involve a fuller presentation of research questions and proposed methods.

It chooses a local narrative approach and situates the investigation in one of China's largest, complex, and most dynamic and globalized cities - Shanghai. The experience of the city and its people reveals the creative and controversial ways people redefined, reconfigured, and reshaped forces such as imperialism, nationalism, consumerism, authoritarianism, liberalism, communism, and capitalism.

We must work to lift people who are underserved; we must expand the range of abilities for those who are caught in only one kind of training; and we must each learn to be creative thinkers contributing our abilities to many sectors of our society.   In this course, we expand our views about learning by experimenting with the creative process of lateral thinking.  In the first six weeks of the semester, we learn about learning by meeting with exceptional people with many scholarly, professional, and civic engagement accomplishments.  We also learn by working in teams to develop an exciting set of 2-D / 3-D, hands-on, problem-solving workshops for middle-schoolers from economically disadvantaged urban families; the workshop curriculum is be based upon your knowledge and passion as well as your interests. During the last eight weeks, we deliver these workshops once a week to students at Compton-Drew Middle School (adjacent to the Science Center in the city of St. Louis).  In this course we celebrate the choices of studies we each pursue, and expand our experience by learning from each other's knowledge bases and creativity.  The course is offered each Fall and Spring semester, and is open to students from all disciplines, schools, freshmen through seniors, and meets the Multidisciplinary Fieldwork requirement for AMCS majors.  **Attendance Mandatory for the first week of Classes.**  NOTE: On class days scheduled for the middle school, students must account for transportation time between WU and Compton-Drew so plan accordingly to ensure arrival by 1pm.\n\nTo meet compliance with University Policies on Minors, all students participating in this class will be required to undergo a fingerprinting background check, which is done on campus, prior to interacting with the Compton-Drew students.

Why have so many novels and films memorialized adolescence? How has the period of development been portrayed in recent American fiction? How have depictions and attitudes toward teen culture changed over the past fifty years? We will begin with J.D. Salinger's classic novel of adolescence alienation, \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" a book that in many ways helped initiate the rise of the youth movement in the 1950s and 60s. From there, we will read a series of novels and historical studies that will trace the changes in teen culture that have occurred over the past half century. Our class will also consider a few films, such as \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and \"Dazed and Confused,\" which have helped shape our conception of the American teenager. Ultimately, we will question what these depictions of teen culture can tell us about larger trends and concerns in American life. Possible readings include John Updike's \"The Centaur,\" Suzanne Collins's \"The Hunger Games,\" and Colson Whitehead's \"Sag Harbor.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

Why has so much power and influence been attributed to it?  This course will address this question by exploring children's television as a genre, industry, and site of public anxiety and debate from the 1950s to the present.  After examining the origins of the genre, we will progress to a consideration of children's television of the post-network era--the age of cable, TiVo, and TV-internet convergence. Topics of consideration will include: the marketing and branding strategies of networks like Nickelodeon; teen television and the viewing habits of its audiences; the relationship between children's television and other media consumed by kids; the gendering of children's TV; and the politics of race in contemporary children's programming.  As we will see, although children's television has transformed radically since the 1950s, the discourses that swirl around it have remained remarkably consistent.  Screenings will consist of both animated and live-action series such as Howdy-Doody, Sesame Street, Degrassi: The Next Generation, Dora the Explorer, and SpongeBob SquarePants.

In this seminar, we will unpack the varied ways eros played out across poetry, philosophy, politics and art in the ancient Greek and Roman world and how these ancient definitions of love still inform our own modern understanding of the term.",

Roman art, by contrast, has been seen as derivative and secondary; Johann Joachim Wincklemann, the founder of modern art history, classified it among the \"style of the imitators.\" But this traditional dichotomy rests in large part on the Romans' own reactions to their encounters with the arts of Greece.  Through the analysis of textual sources, architecture, statuary and painting, this course will investigate the status and influence of Greek art in the city of Rome from the third-century BCE until the late Imperial period, and will seek to understand how Roman responses to and uses of Greek art have come to shape the modern perception of both traditions.

Transmediation refers to the translation, transposition, or adaptation of a work from one sign system, art form, or medium to another. Some art forms, such as opera, film, and video, are inherently multi-media. Others have traditionally been paired: a song based on a poem or a movie based on a book. Some serve as commentaries upon one another: a novel about a painting or a play. Others constitute different versions of the same story: the Pygmalion myth or the Faust legend across the centuries. Works may be adapted for artistic, ideological, or even commercial ends. The digital age has taken the possibilities of story and media adaptation to a new level. We will investigate how works have been transformed as they crossed geographical, temporal, and generic boundaries. Students will consider texts, images, and recordings from the point of view of artists, critics, and consumers and will have the unique opportunity to visit regional exhibits and performances in St. Louis and Chicago.

        "description": "In the later Middle Ages, there is a flowering throughout Christian Europe of religious writings that offer a new voice in which personal religious experience can be pursued and expressed. Their voices are mainly intended to be communal ones, to be contained within the Church and regulated by it. But in each case the fact that it is a voice may offer a mode of resistance, or of difference. Such writing is often aimed at lay people, sometimes exclusively at women; and sometimes the intended auditors become the authors, and propose a version of religious experience that claims a new and more intimate kind of power for its readers.  This course looks at a wide range of such writing in vernacular languages read in translation (English, French and German), including the work of Meister Eckhart, Marguerite Porete, Margery Kempe, Julian of Norwich, Eleanor Hull, the anonymous writer of The Cloud of Unknowing and the perhaps pseudonymous William Langland, author of Piers Plowman. Whether such writing seeks to be orthodox or conducive to heresy, it presents a challenge to the power of clergy - a challenge that is written in the vernacular language of lay people, rather than clerical Latin, and in doing so offers distinctively new voices for religious experience. The course will also look at ways in which such work might have been influenced, if only oppositionally or at times indirectly, by contact with Muslim and Jewish writing (including Jewish exegesis of the Psalms).",

Renaissance humanists, both women and men, became passionately interested in recovering the texts, images, and philosophies of classical antiquity, which included artistic representations of the pagan gods in various media.  At the same time, the Reformation was only the most obvious example of religious crisis and transformation, as new ways of spiritual inquiry and expression struggled to meet the changing world, including the very encounter with classical paganism.  This course examines expressions of the sacred and profane-sometimes synchronized, sometimes in conflict-in Renaissance painting, sculpture, theater, poetry, music, and opera.  Against a contextual survey of all of these forms, the course will concentrate on several major figures, including Botticelli (painting), Michelangelo (painting, sculpture, poetry), Spenser (epic and lyric poetry), Shakespeare (lyric poetry and drama) and Monteverdi (music and opera).",

What can psychoanalytic readings tell us more broadly about the act of reading? How can psychoanalysis enrich our sense of the ethical import of reading and writing, and how can literature challenge psychoanalytic goals and values?  Our main psychoanalytic authors will be Freud, Ernest Jones, Klein, Lacan, and Winnicott. Literary readings will range widely from Sophocles and Shakespeare to Henry James and Alison Bechdel.",

Other humanist writers we will explore include Petrarch, Ficino, and More, and we will also do a unit on women humanists.  In the last part of the course, we will consider what \"humanism,\" as well as \"posthumanism\" and \"transhumanism,\" mean in the twenty-first century.  We will consider the claims of \"humanism\" and the \"human\" in political and legal arenas as well, considering such concepts as \"crimes against humanity.\"   ",

The animating center of the course constitutes an inquiry into the place of literature: where does a literary text belong? We will ask questions about how to describe, categorize, and analyze literature that appears to be operating in a field far beyond the traditional national or even transnational frames of reference common to literary critical discourse. Our debate on world literature will open adjacent conversations on translation, cosmopolitanism, minor literature, transnational poetics, transculturation, and the pedagogy of world literature. Likely critical texts by Erich Auerbach, Edward Said, \u00c9douard Glissant, Aamir Mufti, Emily Apter, David Damrosch, Pascale Casanova, Franco Moretti, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Laura Doyle, and Susan Friedman; novels included will be by authors such as Mulk Raj Anand, Jean Rhys, J.M.

Transmediation refers to the translation, transposition, or adaptation of a work from one sign system, art form, or medium to another. Some art forms, such as opera, film, and video, are inherently multi-media. Others have traditionally been paired: a song based on a poem or a movie based on a book. Some serve as commentaries upon one another: a novel about a painting or a play. Others constitute different versions of the same story: the Pygmalion myth or the Faust legend across the centuries. Works may be adapted for artistic, ideological, or even commercial ends. The digital age has taken the possibilities of story and media adaptation to a new level. We will investigate how works have been transformed as they crossed geographical, temporal, and generic boundaries. Students will consider texts, images, and recordings from the point of view of artists, critics, and consumers and will have the unique opportunity to visit regional exhibits and performances in St. Louis and Chicago.

From its appearance in 1818, the story of Frankenstein touched the imagination, raising powerful questions about who we are. What did the novel say to the English society in which it first appeared? What does it tell us about 21st Century America? Is it a story about the dangers of science loosed from its moorings? Is this \"Modern Prometheus\" (the novel's subtitle) a tale of Man's presumption in assuming the mantle of the divine? Is it a story of the corruption of child-like innocence? Or is it a modern parable of the Outsider-centering on the (nameless) creature's strange physiognomy, and his essential \"Otherness\"? A story which somehow connects a 19th Century English novel with the development of the classic horror film, Civil Rights activist Dick Gregory, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Andy Warhol, and Mel Brooks (Young Frankenstein), along with countless toys, comic books and video games still has much to offer us today. The seminar combines critical analysis with historical research, incorporating readings from a number of disciplines. In addition to a culminating research paper, students will be asked to create and develop an original performance piece based on the legend of Frankenstein.",

Students will be introduced to the \"Joker\" system, developed by Brazilian director Augusto Boal. The Joker is the director of a forum theater event.  He leads both the exploration and play-making phases of the process.  \nIn preparation for stepping into this role, students will read Paulo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed which will give them a foundation in the power and efficacy of collaborative educational techniques.  In addition, students will read Theatre for Living, Canadian director David Diamond's book detailing his application of Boalian techniques in a less overtly oppressive society.  \nStudents will begin their practical exploration by first working with one another, learning how to lead exercises and games, followed by an exploration of play making and the facilitation of an interactive forum theater event.  \nThe course will culminate in an outside project in which each student is placed with a St. Louis area school or social organization.  The student will apply skills he has acquired throughout the semester by serving as the \"Joker\" of the workshop.  In this role, the student will lead the entirety of the workshop process with a selected group exploring ways of effecting positive social change in a theatrical context.

The student will guide play-making with the group that highlights this area of oppression.  The resulting plays will then be presented to the larger school or organization community.

Williams' career spanned six decades, including two (1918-38) growing up in St. Louis, and one important year (1936-37), enrolled at Washington University. While he wrote a number of masterpieces (The Glass Menagerie, A Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof), he also wrote many plays which remain virtually unknown, but which are worthy of renewed exploration. The playwright's tortured and self-destructive life and mysterious death (including his addiction to drugs and alcohol) hold a mirror up to American culture, especially with regard to the writer's first closeted, then flamboyantly gay life-style. This seminar offers an opportunity to examine this brilliant, flawed, and obsessive writer in depth.

In order to understand the stakes of the philosophical and organizational debates that emerged during that time, we will begin with a study of important antecedents in transnational pacifist movements, women's suffrage, the interracial sit-down strikes of the 1930s, and the Indian independence movement. We will explore some of the questions that occupied mid-century activists: is nonviolence an internal philosophical or theological position that all protestors must embrace with sincerity? Or is it a theatrical tactic designed for the benefit of television audiences? Does the repetition of nonviolence risk diluting its power? How can ordinary people be encouraged to overcome their \"conditioned reflex\" to violence? We will ask: how do aesthetic considerations of choreographies of passivity-stillness, pliability, falling, going limp, being carried away-inform the \"doing nothing\" of nonviolence? How are such techniques learned and taught, and how did the emerging fields of sociodrama and psychodrama inform the rehearsals for confrontation with the state? Finally, we will consider the future of nonviolence in a Trump presidency. If, as Richard Gregg argued in the 1930s, nonviolent noncooperation in India was effective largely because it engendered \"surprise, curiosity, and wonder\" on the part of military opposition and onlookers, what new approaches are needed now that nonviolent direct action has become part of the anticipated playbook of protest?

Transmediation refers to the translation, transposition, or adaptation of a work from one sign system, art form, or medium to another. Some art forms, such as opera, film, and video, are inherently multi-media. Others have traditionally been paired: a song based on a poem or a movie based on a book. Some serve as commentaries upon one another: a novel about a painting or a play. Others constitute different versions of the same story: the Pygmalion myth or the Faust legend across the centuries. Works may be adapted for artistic, ideological, or even commercial ends. The digital age has taken the possibilities of story and media adaptation to a new level. We will investigate how works have been transformed as they crossed geographical, temporal, and generic boundaries.

It's no secret that the violent abduction and sexual assault of women plays a constant-sometimes central, sometimes incidental-role in myth, history, fictional narrative, and poetry from the ancient Greeks to today. This class will consider the omnipresence of sexual violence in English literary history (and its antecedents) and ask why it is there, what its effects are, and how it shapes the way we think about gender, violence, freedom, and desire. This course contends that literature and literary history are keys to understanding the relationship between culture and sexual violence, and, conversely, that attention to sexual violence is key to understanding literary history. Students will acquire a broad historical understanding of consent as it evolved in literary, legal, and philosophical discourses to become a concept that organizes sexual and political freedom. We will ask: Is consent the best framework through which to mediate sexual harm? Are there alternative ways to imagine sexual encounters? How do various media manage sexual experiences? From the medieval romance to the eighteenth-century pornographic novel, from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" to \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" this course will interrogate how literary explorations of consent provoke theories of subjectivity, desire, and power.",

        "description": "In the later Middle Ages, there is a flowering throughout Christian Europe of religious writings that offer a new voice in which personal religious experience can be pursued and expressed. Their voices are mainly intended to be communal ones, to be contained within the Church and regulated by it. But in each case the fact that it is a voice may offer a mode of resistance, or of difference. Such writing is often aimed at lay people, sometimes exclusively at women; and sometimes the intended auditors become the authors, and propose a version of religious experience that claims a new and more intimate kind of power for its readers.  This course looks at a wide range of such writing in vernacular languages read in translation (English, French and German), including the work of Meister Eckhart, Marguerite Porete, Margery Kempe, Julian of Norwich, Eleanor Hull, the anonymous writer of The Cloud of Unknowing and the perhaps pseudonymous William Langland, author of Piers Plowman. Whether such writing seeks to be orthodox or conducive to heresy, it presents a challenge to the power of clergy - a challenge that is written in the vernacular language of lay people, rather than clerical Latin, and in doing so offers distinctively new voices for religious experience. The course will also look at ways in which such work might have been influenced, if only oppositionally or at times indirectly, by contact with Muslim and Jewish writing (including Jewish exegesis of the Psalms).",

How did we get to this point in disability representation, and is where we are now any different from even a few decades ago: when disability marked childhood boogeymen like Scar or Voldemort and the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act became law? Historically, authors have represented characters who mentally and physically deviate from cultural standards of \"normal\" functioning or appearance. These textual strategies have coalesced around common tropes of disability representation-the malformed villain, the pitiful sick victim, the \"supercrip.\" In our course we will question these common categories as well as consider the proliferation of new ways of imagining disability: Who gets to belong? Who possesses a body that matters? How does disability representation affect everyday understandings of disability? Exploring 20th-century texts, we will discuss disability as a minority identity, one both bodily and socially constructed.

Why have so many novels and films memorialized adolescence? How has the period of development been portrayed in recent American fiction? How have depictions and attitudes toward teen culture changed over the past fifty years? We will begin with J.D. Salinger's classic novel of adolescence alienation, \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" a book that in many ways helped initiate the rise of the youth movement in the 1950s and 60s. From there, we will read a series of novels and historical studies that will trace the changes in teen culture that have occurred over the past half century. Our class will also consider a few films, such as \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and \"Dazed and Confused,\" which have helped shape our conception of the American teenager. Ultimately, we will question what these depictions of teen culture can tell us about larger trends and concerns in American life. Possible readings include John Updike's \"The Centaur,\" Suzanne Collins's \"The Hunger Games,\" and Colson Whitehead's \"Sag Harbor.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

An inexhaustible public witness and the author of plays, essays, novels, and short stories, the Harlem-born Baldwin ranks with the most daring and eloquent American voices of the twentieth century. His first novel, the autobiographical \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" (1953), wrestled with the heritage of black Christianity and black social realism. His second novel, \"Giovanni's Room\" (1956), set in Paris and peopled with non-black characters, explored the complexity of same-sex desire years before the Stonewall riots announced the gay rights movement. \"Notes of a Native Son\" (1955), the first collection of Baldwin's lush and searching essays, is perhaps the most-tweeted book of our era and is listed among the Modern Library's top twenty nonfiction books of the twentieth century.  Our reading list will contain all of these books, but we'll also begin with Richard Wright's novel \"Native Son\" (1940), the young Baldwin's defining aesthetic enemy, and end with Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir \"Between the World and Me\" (2015), the prize-winning Baldwin rewrite that illuminates the older author's elevated reputation in the wake of Black Lives Matter.

Writing about our life is not only, as Benjamin Franklin said, the next best thing to reliving it; it may also be an improvement on it, both in the story it tells and in the satisfaction it gives in bringing chaos to order. The course will explore the activity of going back in memory both in autobiographical writing and in fiction.

Wells, Jean Rhys, Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad, and a number of other canonical and non-canonical writers.  In their novels, novellas, and short fiction, these writers take account of a profound change in the metrics and meanings of time, which, following the establishment of Greenwich Mean Time at the end of the nineteenth century, shifted the experience of time from a \"natural\" (daily, seasonal, annual) to an \"artificial' (numerical, standard, global) measure.  This new standard time, also known as \"rational\" or \"public\" time, stimulated interesting, significant, and lasting resistance from major artists and thinkers and writers.  What we know as \"the stream of consciousness,\" for instance, witnesses a new emphasis on \"private\" internal time as a reaction to rational, public time.  We will follow this evolving sense of time into and through some of the cataclysmic, not so \"rational\" events in real historical time: two World Wars (both undergone and anticipated), the rising and spreading crises of Empire, a global financial meltdown, and the near-revolutions achieved by the women's and workers' movements.  Here the understanding of the meaning and shape of history and the direction of historical time is richly conflicted, and the literature of the period takes the measure of this duress.

In this course we will encounter the monsters of Beowulf, the ambiguous fairies of Breton lais such as Sir Orfeo, as well as the the demons, dragons, and giants of medieval romances like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Sir Bevis of Hampton. But we will also explore how religion, culture, and even gender could contribute to the \"otherness\" of characters in stories about Saracen knights and strident Saracen heroines, as well as in the travel accounts of writers like John Mandeville.

        "description": "James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" is probably the most important novel of the twentieth century, and possibly of English literary history. It is also the funniest, but perhaps also-at least initially-the most difficult. As such, it lends itself to the sustained single focus of a 400-level English course. We will read the book first of all for its intrinsic interest, examining the use of the Homeric parallel as well as of the various organizational schemes Joyce devised in writing the novel. We will also reference the novel to a number of external contexts: as an example of the emergent project of literary Modernism; as an imaginative remaking of the Irish political and religious culture in which Joyce grew up; as a vision of a new Europe in the aftermath of the First World War; as a daring experiment in fashioning new gender imaginaries, for female as well as male characters; and, most of all, as a reinvention of the form of the novel, which extends tendencies in modern linguistic thought to unprecedented dimensions. These considerations will be supplemented and enriched by various critical accounts of the novel, ranging from helpful expositions to understandings of the novel's impact on subsequent literary history. Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

What can psychoanalytic readings tell us more broadly about the act of reading? How can psychoanalysis enrich our sense of the ethical import of reading and writing, and how can literature challenge psychoanalytic goals and values?  Our main psychoanalytic authors will be Freud, Ernest Jones, Klein, Lacan, and Winnicott. Literary readings will range widely from Sophocles and Shakespeare to Henry James and Alison Bechdel.",

We will investigate-and with our authors question-what have come to be seen as the conventions of Irish narrative in the 20th century that are, in part, legacies of centuries-old Irish-language traditions:  discontinuous storylines, unstable boundaries between places, temporalities, and personalities, and a delight in the sounding, invention, and confusion of names and words.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, one theme that binds these Irish texts is secrecy and, as its corollary, suspicion, with espionage or surveillance and its coded language-a version of Joyce's phrase \"exile and cunning-an explicit plotline . Texts include \"Picture of Dorian Gray\" (Oscar Wilde), poems, stories, and essays by W. B.Yeats and Louis MacNeice, \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" (James Joyce), \"The Heat of the Day\" (Elizabeth Bowen),  \"At Swim-Two-Birds\" (Flann O'Brien), and excerpts from Samuel Beckett's late-career \"closed space\" tales \"Nohow On.\"  Texts by contemporary Irish writers include \"The Untouchable\" (John Banville), poems and essays by Eil\u00e9an N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in, and Ciaran Carson's multi-generic \"Belfast Confetti,\" excerptions from his translation of the Irish-language epic \"The Tain,\" and his sci-fi folk tale \"Shamrock Tea.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

We will emphasize the subversive ideas of the humanists, as they revived materialist, atheistic writers such as Lucretius, sought to reconcile different religious faiths (Pico della Mirandola), promoted liberal inquiry on two sides of a question (Erasmus), considered whether the universe might be infinite (Giordano Bruno),  celebrated the critical and humane power of laughter (Rabelais), and considered the body and human experience as the central philosophical index (Montaigne).  Other humanist writers we will explore include Petrarch, Ficino, and More, and we will also do a unit on women humanists.  In the last part of the course, we will consider what \"humanism,\" as well as \"posthumanism\" and \"transhumanism,\" mean in the twenty-first century.  We will consider the claims of \"humanism\" and the \"human\" in political and legal arenas as well, considering such concepts as \"crimes against humanity.\"   ",

The animating center of the course constitutes an inquiry into the place of literature: where does a literary text belong? We will ask questions about how to describe, categorize, and analyze literature that appears to be operating in a field far beyond the traditional national or even transnational frames of reference common to literary critical discourse. Our debate on world literature will open adjacent conversations on translation, cosmopolitanism, minor literature, transnational poetics, transculturation, and the pedagogy of world literature.

It situates the investigation of urban transformation in two contexts: the domestic context of modern China's reform and revolution and the global context of the international flow of people, products, capitals, and ideas. It chooses a local narrative approach and situates the investigation in one of China's largest, complex, and most dynamic and globalized cities - Shanghai. The experience of the city and its people reveals the creative and controversial ways people redefined, reconfigured, and reshaped forces such as imperialism, nationalism, consumerism, authoritarianism, liberalism, communism, and capitalism. The course also seeks to go beyond the \"Shanghai model\" by comparing Shanghai with other Chinese cities. It presents a range of the urban experience in modern China.",

Considered to be one of the most important texts in Chinese history, it triggered a wide range of discourses on the nature of the universe and good living while informing diverse practices such as calligraphy, landscape painting, poetry, drama, Daoist ritual, Zen Buddhism, sitting meditation, and politics. In this course, we engage in both the Daoist classic's multifaceted content and its diverse reception over the last two millennia. In the first half, we read the Zhuangzi as a primary source focusing on its short philosophical vignettes on the possibility and limits of knowledge and language, its humorous anecdotes that celebrate deformed and useless bodies, its youthful invectives against Confucians, as well as its powerful calls to live a creative and independent life as a recluse. In the second half, we will encounter concrete responses to the Zhuangzi in the form of commentaries, paintings, plays, performances, and comic books that exemplify the scripture's far-ranging cultural impact. This course provides both a focused and multifaceted avenue to the cultural history of East Asia and a personal experience of the life-changing appeal and topicality of the text.",

Melodrama has variously been defined as a genre, a logic, an affect, and a mode, applied to diverse media, divergent cultural traditions, and different historical contexts. The course provides a survey of East Asian melodrama films-as well as films that challenge conventional definitions of melodrama-by pairing Japanese, Korean, and Chinese-language productions with key critical texts in melodrama studies. We will see classics such as Tokyo Story, Two Stage Sisters, and The Housemaid. We will examine melodrama's complex ties to modernity, tradition, and cultural transformation in East Asia; special emphasis will be placed on representations of the family, historical change, gender, and sexuality. In addition to historical background and film studies concepts, we will also consider a range of approaches for thinking about the aesthetics and politics of emotion. No prerequisites. No prior knowledge of East Asian culture or language necessary. REQUIRED SCREENING: Wednesdays @ 4pm",

How do these formations and changes relate to literary and cinematic portraits of gender on one hand and to gendered conceptions of literature and cinema on the other?

The intensity of U.S.-China partnership and rivalry can be discerned in a wide range of national and international events such as the colonial expansion and imperialist invasion in the 19th century, the nationalist movement and cultural modernization in the early 20th century, the Pacific War and the Cold War, the pro-democracy movement in China and the human rights debate, and China's economic reform and its rise as a global economic and political power in the 21st century. By drawing on scholarship in political and social history and area studies, this course analyzes both the historical context and contemporary developments of US-China relations. It helps students better understand the formation and transformation of Sino-American relations and its impacts on domestic, regional, and global history.",

        "description": "The Daoist classic Zhuangzi, a collection of cryptic sayings and short anecdotes attributed to the mysterious Master Zhuang Zhou (trad. 369-286 BCE), has deeply influenced cultural life in East Asia. Considered to be one of the most important texts in Chinese history, it triggered a wide range of discourses on the nature of the universe and good living while informing diverse practices such as calligraphy, landscape painting, poetry, drama, Daoist ritual, Zen Buddhism, sitting meditation, and politics. In this course, we engage in both the Daoist classic's multifaceted content and its diverse reception over the last two millennia. In the first half, we read the Zhuangzi as a primary source focusing on its short philosophical vignettes on the possibility and limits of knowledge and language, its humorous anecdotes that celebrate deformed and useless bodies, its youthful invectives against Confucians, as well as its powerful calls to live a creative and independent life as a recluse. In the second half, we will encounter concrete responses to the Zhuangzi in the form of commentaries, paintings, plays, performances, and comic books that exemplify the scripture's far-ranging cultural impact. This course provides both a focused and multifaceted avenue to the cultural history of East Asia and a personal experience of the life-changing appeal and topicality of the text.",

The course begins by defining the basic institutions and structures of the medieval Mediterranean, such as banking and credit operations, trading partnerships, and the position of the merchant within Renaissance society. The focus then shifts to merchant capital in an era of centralization, as the Dutch develop their world trade hegemony and the increasingly centralized states support of monopoly companies and mercantilist policies. The course ends by looking at the expanding world of commerce in the era of integration, as European merchants entrench their control of production and trade throughout the globe through their increased social and political importance, the spread of the putting-out system, and the refinement of colonial policies.

How come we have the impression that most useful inventions took place in the last three centuries? Are there policies that help fostering innovation and others that hurt? The course tries to address these questions.\n\nEconomists have many theories of innovation, and some better than others. We will look at the theories, we will examine the facts (past and present), then we will go back to the theories and reconsider their explanatory power.

This course will address three essential topics from the wide-ranging field of the economics of education. The first is demand-side oriented and includes: (i) the measurement of the returns to education in the labor market (human capital theory; the central idea of education as human capital investment); and (ii) a characterization of the education production function, which relates the various inputs affecting a student\u00b4s learning (schools, families, peers, neighborhoods, etc.) to measure outputs including labor market success, graduation rates and standardized test scores. The second important topic involves political economy and the supply side: the financing and provision of education. The third part of the course is devoted to the links between education and economic development, including cross-country differences in schooling, returns to schooling and per-capita income.

In each, students will engage with course readings and in-class discussions addressing a specific facet of the field of education (e.g. students, schools, the learning process) and investigate how it manifests itself similarly or differently across the global community and why. Students will explore the relationship between education and nation-state, and critically evaluate this relationship in: (1) a final paper in which they examine an educational issue in the United States as well as a nation of their choice, and (2) a semester-long group project in which they design the \"ideal\" education system based on what they have learned about education worldwide.",

Some leaders believe that the sole purpose of business is to maximize shareholder wealth and that profitability (or fiscal sustainability) is not compatible with environmental responsibility. In reality, ecological and economic performance need not-and should not-be mutually exclusive. Fortunately, the outmoded mindset of \"profit-at-any-cost\" is beginning to shift as organizations recognize the importance of adopting balanced business practices that promote economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental quality. Organizations that embed sustainability into their corporate strategies increase operational efficiency by using resources more responsibly and minimizing waste. In an increasingly crowded and competitive marketplace, sustainability has become a source of competitive advantage through which an organization can have a positive impact not only on the \"bottom line\" but also on the environment and society. In this course, we explore key concepts, debates, and issues driving sustainability in business. We will also look at various sustainability tools, principles, and frameworks that business can use to better understand the natural systems from which sustainability is derived and upon which all organisms and organizations rely to sustain their own existence.",

If these trends continue we will face some very difficult times ecologically and socio-politically.\n \nOne alternative to infinite-planet economic theory is Ecological Economics, which can be described as economics as if the laws of thermodynamics are true and apply to us. Alone among disciplines with any aspiration to analytic rigor, the field of economics has remained unaffected by the thermodynamic revolution that transformed such fields as biology, chemistry, physics, even history in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  This failure to take physical law into account is one great source of our society's environmental (and social, and political) problems.  Ecological economics thus represents the continuation of the thermodynamic revolution begun in the 1880s.\n \nThis course is designed to give you an appropriate grounding in the fundamental assumptions, the conceptual novelties, and the distinctive tools of analysis that comprise this emergent school of economic theory, while placing this theorizing in historical (and ecological) context.   We'll pay particular attention to how the precepts and practice of Ecological Economics illuminate the largest challenge facing humans today, the necessity of developing an ecologically sustainable society, one that is sized to the limits of our finite planet.

Nuclear technology has long been developed, used and debated.  Capable of both healing and harm, it challenges our notions of risk verses benefit at every level.  It is also poised to potentially play a significant environmental role in climate mitigation by delivering large amounts of nearly carbon-free energy. Using texts such as literary non-fiction, history, environmental anthropology, natural history and public health, we will explore aspects of the Manhattan Project, the Chernobyl Nuclear Reactor accident, the presence of fear in the public perception of nuclear technology, and debates regarding the current and future use of nuclear energy.

Why, when we have so much evidence that vaccines reduce illness and death and are extremely safe, do individuals still choose not to vaccinate their children? What if I told you that the scientific evidence does not matter? Over the last few decades, neither better education, nor guilt, nor fear have worked to produce change on these important issues. In this class we will explore different factors contributing to why scientific evidence doesn't matter for the individual choices we make or policies we support, how we might talk to one another in a way that might shift thinking or behavior, and how we can create evidence-based policy. We will explore themes of argumentation, worldview, cognitive linguistics and framing, cognitive dissonance, risk perception, empathy, habit changes, bungles in messaging, and difficult dialoguing through the examples of climate change and vaccination. Course activities will consist of reading, some online research, and reflective journaling at home, and engaging in conversation during class. \nThere are no pre-requisites but the class is designed to target upper level students in environmental majors and pre-health studies.

Likely topics include the minimum Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI) required to sustain a complex civilization; the theory and practice of alternative indicators like the Genuine Progress Indicator and Gross National Happiness; the \"Slumlord Economy\" that consumes natural capital as income, impoverishing our (ecological) neighborhoods through degradation of their constituent elements;  EROEI as an explanatory factor in the evolution of species, ecosystems, and civilizations; international and intergenerational environmental justice; and social change vehicles like the Transition Town movement.  The common thread will be pursuit of a deeper understanding of the implications of recognizing the laws of thermodynamics as the unifying ground for ecology and economy, as those laws set limits to the structure, scale and function (including reproductive success) of complex systems in both areas.",

Engineering and Arts & Sciences students participate in interdisciplinary teams with law students, handling environmental projects for public interest, environmental or community organizations or individuals. Students from other schools may also participate with permission of instructors. Projects may involve the following activities: representing clients in federal and state court litigation and administrative proceedings; drafting proposed legislation; commenting on proposed regulations, permits, environmental impact statements or environmental assessments, and similar documents; giving public testimony and participating in workgroup or stakeholder meetings; analyzing and interpreting environmental data and reports; and evaluating matters for potential future action. The goal is that for each project, students will have primary responsibility for handling the matter, and faculty will play a secondary, supervisory role. Non-law students may provide such technical support as investigating unknown facts, evaluating facts presented by other parties (such as in government reports), and working with law students to develop and present facts relevant to an understanding of and resolution of the matter. Non-law students must work at least an average of 12 hours per week on clinic matters, including attendance at and participation each week in: at least one individual meeting with the professor; one group meeting involving the student team assigned to each project and the professors; and a two-hour seminar for all students in the clinic. Prerequisites: The clinic is open to graduate students and upper-level undergraduates with coursework and/or experience in environmental engineering, environmental science, or related fields. Students who register for the clinic are also required to submit a resume and a brief statement of interest to Clinic Scientist Ken Miller at kenneth.miller@wustl.edu.

Classes will feature hands-on exercises selected to help you master advanced GIS analysis tools and techniques, while providing experience in the planning and execution of real-world projects.  Primary emphasis will be on applying fundamental GIS concepts, performing spatial analysis, developing proficiency with core ArcGIS software (e.g., Network Analyst extension), resolution of problems, and efficient delivery of results. Readings from books and scientific literature will introduce key concepts and provide real-world examples that will be reinforced in the hands-on exercises, assignments, and projects.  As the semester develops, you will gain a variety of new tools and techniques that will allow you to complete a final independent project that integrates the material learned during the course.",

At its core, it asks the question, what did it mean for the Jews of Central and Eastern Europe to emerge from small market towns and villages to confront modern ethnicities, nations, and empires? What lasting impact did the shtetl experience have on Jewish life in a rapidly changing environment? The focus is on the Jewish historical experience in the countries that make up Central and Eastern Europe (mainly the Bohemian lands, Hungary, Poland, and Russia) from the late eighteenth century to the fall of the Soviet Union. Among the topics that we will cover are: Jews and the nobility in Poland-Lithuania; the multi-cultural, imperial state; Hasidism and its opponents; absolutism and reform in imperial settings; the emergence of modern European nationalisms and their impact on Jewish identity; antisemitism and popular violence; nationalist and radical movements among Jews; war, revolution, and genocide; and the transition from Soviet dominion to democratic states.

From the nineteenth century to the present day, writers and filmmakers have revisited (and often subverted) questions that Dostoevsky's novel poses: What internal and external forces cause someone to \"step over\" into crime? What are the implications of a confession? To what extent can the legal system provide a just punishment? Are forgiveness and redemption possible, or even relevant? What role does grace--or luck--play in the entire process?  This course begins with our close reading of Dostoevsky's novel and then moves on to short stories, novels, literary essays, and movies that engage in dialogue with the Russian predecessor. A central concern of our intertextual approach is to explore the interplay between specific socio-historical contexts and universal questions. All readings are in English. No prerequisites.",

We will investigate-and with our authors question-what have come to be seen as the conventions of Irish narrative in the 20th century that are, in part, legacies of centuries-old Irish-language traditions:  discontinuous storylines, unstable boundaries between places, temporalities, and personalities, and a delight in the sounding, invention, and confusion of names and words.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, one theme that binds these Irish texts is secrecy and, as its corollary, suspicion, with espionage or surveillance and its coded language-a version of Joyce's phrase \"exile and cunning-an explicit plotline . Texts include \"Picture of Dorian Gray\" (Oscar Wilde), poems, stories, and essays by W. B.Yeats and Louis MacNeice, \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" (James Joyce), \"The Heat of the Day\" (Elizabeth Bowen),  \"At Swim-Two-Birds\" (Flann O'Brien), and excerpts from Samuel Beckett's late-career \"closed space\" tales \"Nohow On.\"  Texts by contemporary Irish writers include \"The Untouchable\" (John Banville), poems and essays by Eil\u00e9an N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in, and Ciaran Carson's multi-generic \"Belfast Confetti,\" excerptions from his translation of the Irish-language epic \"The Tain,\" and his sci-fi folk tale \"Shamrock Tea.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

In tracing the outlines of Hitchcock's long career, we will pair seven of his greatest films with the films and film theories they inspired, many of them reflecting the critical and creative legacy of feminist and queer theory.  In each pairing, the contemporary film is, in some way, a critical revision of Hitchcock's original, one that is revelatory of Hitchcock's brilliance and blindnesses.  Pairings will likely include Psycho with Harron's American Psycho, Rebecca with Jane Campion's The Piano,  Rear Window with Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty, Vertigo with Fincher's Gone Girl.  By the end of the course, students will have a deep understanding of the way that Hitchcock's movies live on in the visual culture we see around us and the ways we have learned to see it.

We will read several of Fleming's novels and short stories, including Casino Royale (1953), \"Octopussy\" (1966) and \"The Property of a Lady\" (1967), and discuss these texts in light of post-war spy literature.  We will screen numerous Bond films, and compare and contrast James Bond the literary and cinematic character, how Bond emerged as a franchise hero through the vision of producers Harry Saltzman and Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli, and critical aspects of the film franchise, including its storytelling roots in Hollywood serials, its use of gadgets and special effects, and the role of stardom in their marketing (Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, Roger Moore, Madonna, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig).  Finally, we will explore the re-envisioning of Bond in various media and art forms in global popular culture, including music, DC and Marvel Comics, games, children's television and in Asian cinema (Stephen Chow's 1994 From Beijing with Love).

Why has so much power and influence been attributed to it?  This course will address this question by exploring children's television as a genre, industry, and site of public anxiety and debate from the 1950s to the present.  After examining the origins of the genre, we will progress to a consideration of children's television of the post-network era--the age of cable, TiVo, and TV-internet convergence. Topics of consideration will include: the marketing and branding strategies of networks like Nickelodeon; teen television and the viewing habits of its audiences; the relationship between children's television and other media consumed by kids; the gendering of children's TV; and the politics of race in contemporary children's programming.  As we will see, although children's television has transformed radically since the 1950s, the discourses that swirl around it have remained remarkably consistent.  Screenings will consist of both animated and live-action series such as Howdy-Doody, Sesame Street, Degrassi: The Next Generation, Dora the Explorer, and SpongeBob SquarePants.

We will examine melodrama's complex ties to modernity, tradition, and cultural transformation in East Asia; special emphasis will be placed on representations of the family, historical change, gender, and sexuality.

We grapple with the question of when people in East Asia -- China, Taiwan, the Koreas, and Japan -- act as a members of a transnational region and when they act in ideological, national, or local terms. We evaluate different disciplinary approaches in order to understand the combination of knowledge and skills necessary for drawing meaningful research conclusions. In reading articles produced by a range of scholars and institutions, the course is also an introduction to the politics of the production of knowledge about East Asia. We then apply our knowledge to a real-world conflict and give team presentations on our proposed solutions. This course is restricted to freshmen in the Global Citizenship Program.",

To appreciate this small nation's rocky road to a successful entrance into the European Union, economic security and national confidence, we will closely read how Ireland's rich and diverse literature casts a cold but feeling eye on its hard-earned independence and fraught nationalism.

Can one effectively depict the event in realistic terms, or do unrealistic representations work better?  What happens to the history of the Holocaust when it becomes the subject of a fictional text?  Who is authorized to speak for the victims?  Are representations of perpetrators appropriate?  What types of representations will help us to remember the Holocaust in the twenty-first century?  We will grapple with these challenging questions by examining both literary texts by American, European and Israeli authors from a range of genres, including survivor memoirs, fictional narratives, a graphic novel, drama and poetry, and a number of films that depict the Holocaust.",

        "description": "Ever since their conquest of Algiers in 1830, the French have been fascinated by writing from and about North Africa. Beginning with nineteenth-century French travel narratives about Algeria, colonial-era writing defined ideas of the \"exotic.\" As Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia gained independence from France in the mid-twentieth century, North African authors often wrote their own postcolonial literature in the language of their former colonizer. These authors and their contemporary descendants continue to create and challenge the ideas of postcolonial francophone literature today. The main seminar sessions are taught in English, with additional required weekly undergraduate discussions (section A) in French. Prerequisites: for undergraduates, French 325 or French 326 or French 383 or the equivalent WU transfer literature course from Toulouse or Paris; for graduates not in French, reading knowledge of the language.",

Objects include jewels and houses and other things that we build and consume-material things that we see, touch, hear, smell, and taste to enhance our lives. Objects also refers to the men and women caught in love triangles, family struggles, and acts of deception, as it does to lovers subject to the manipulations of others. We will examine letters and body parts in Ab\u00e9lard and H\u00e9lo\u00efse; roses in the poetry of Ronsard; paintings in Lafayette's PRINCESSE DE CL\u00c8VES; the organization and selected articles of the Encyclop\u00e9die; gifts in LA DAME AUX CAM\u00c9LIAS by Dumas fils; exquisite everyday objects in Ponge's poetry; the novel in Butor's MODIFICATION; sharks in Ono-dit-Biot's prize-winning contemporary novel PLONGER. The class will consider materialism; the accumulation of wealth; woman as object; the art of seduction; and places charged with memories. Visual works from each period, including still lifes, genre paintings, and landscapes, will help us explore the function of description as rooted in the observation and recording of phenomena, and thus to the irrepressible human desire to know.

        "description": "Political representation is a central mechanism of modern democracies, assuring through elections that the people can delegate power and are still the sovereign. In the last ten years, however, political theorists interested in the concept of political representation have stressed that it can occur in different ways within and outside of political institutions. Representation appears to be fluid and sometimes even an unstable process; it can be performed by elected and by non-elected actors; and it involves both discursive and symbolic mechanisms. This constructivist perspective opens the floor for concepts that include the symbolic dimension of political representation, while also bringing political theory in stronger dialogue with history and cultural studies. The course offers an interdisciplinary view on the topic, reading key works of political theory alongside a range of German and non-German primary sources. We will consider political representation as a symbolic activity, paying particular attention to symbolic practices, aesthetics, performativity, and the role of the body. Possible authors include D\u00f6rner, G\u00f6hler, Kantorowicz, Lefort, Manow, Pitkin, Saward, Schmitt; the course will include the analysis of images, videos, and rituals.

We will start with the ancient Israelites and the Hebrew Bible, and then move on to the major groups of Second Temple Judaism; the classical rabbis and their literature; and the Jewish communities of the premodern worlds of Islam and Christendom. More than a third of the semester will be dedicated to the Jewish experience in modern Europe, the US, and Israel. We will get to know some of the major literary works that Jews produced and studied and learn to understand them as both expressions of Jewish identity and responses to specific historical circumstances. The course, furthermore, aims to challenge widespread stereotypes of Jewish history, such as its \"lachrymose conception\" (Salo W. Baron) as a mere series of suffering and persecution. By contrast, we will investigate when and how Jews were actors in their own right and actively engaged with other cultures, religions, and social groups. Prior study or knowledge of Judaism is not a prerequisite for taking this course.",

At its core, it asks the question, what did it mean for the Jews of Central and Eastern Europe to emerge from small market towns and villages to confront modern ethnicities, nations, and empires? What lasting impact did the shtetl experience have on Jewish life in a rapidly changing environment? The focus is on the Jewish historical experience in the countries that make up Central and Eastern Europe (mainly the Bohemian lands, Hungary, Poland, and Russia) from the late eighteenth century to the fall of the Soviet Union. Among the topics that we will cover are: Jews and the nobility in Poland-Lithuania; the multi-cultural, imperial state; Hasidism and its opponents; absolutism and reform in imperial settings; the emergence of modern European nationalisms and their impact on Jewish identity; antisemitism and popular violence; nationalist and radical movements among Jews; war, revolution, and genocide; and the transition from Soviet dominion to democratic states.

        "description": "The idea of owning one's own home has been central to realizations of the American dream or the \"good life.\" By 1931, Herbert Hoover called the idea \"a sentiment deep in the heart of our race and of American life.\" While the dream continues, the reality of homeownership has been elusive or fraught with struggle and sacrifice for many Americans. If home ownership is such a central part of American identity, why have so many generations of Americans struggled to achieve it?\n\nIn this course, we explore the histories of different versions of home and homeownership by touching down in different locations at pivotal moments in order to investigate the varied meanings of housing and homeownership in the context of a particular place and time in American history.  Using a case-study approach, the course travels across time and space to explore diverse forms of housing, including the following: the big house and slave house in the south under slavery, the immigrant tenement in New York City, the company town in south Chicago, the Midwest homestead, the planned postwar suburban neighborhood, high rise public housing and gated communities.  This format exposes students to the important role of federal and local policies as well as themes of housing including: homes as private and domestic realms; housing as a commodity and the largest form of American debt; housing as an icon and encoder of social status; housing as exclusionary and inclusionary; housing as racial or socio-economic discrimination; the suburbs and their discontents; and the recent housing crisis.

We will explore the political, social, and cultural histories of each of these cities while tracing changes in architecture and the built environment. We chose these three cities for their diverse and intersecting histories. In many ways, St. Louis, Chicago, and New Orleans represent the major social and political forces that forged the modern American city. From westward expansion and the growth of the slave system, through mass European immigration and industrialization, the rise of Jim Crow and the decline of American industry, suburbanization, mass incarceration, and gentrification: all are visible in the landscapes of these American cities. Segregation of social groups, so often seen as natural or inevitable, is the result of historical processes, political decisions, public policies and individual actions. The course, in addition, will provide you with the opportunity to use some of the research techniques employed by urban scholars. We will engage in a major research project, tracing the history of St. Louis through a variety of primary sources. Our aim will be to trace the historical processes that generated urban landscapes divided along lines of race, class, ethnicity or religion.",

The nineteenth century has thus often been portrayed as a period of sharp decline for China.

At the same time that students look at how money was made, they will consider contemporary responses to these economic practices, from concerns about usury, market manipulations, and increasing luxury consumption to the promotion of commerce as essential to the prosperity and strength of the nation. The course begins by defining the basic institutions and structures of the medieval Mediterranean, such as banking and credit operations, trading partnerships, and the position of the merchant within Renaissance society. The focus then shifts to merchant capital in an era of centralization, as the Dutch develop their world trade hegemony and the increasingly centralized states support of monopoly companies and mercantilist policies. The course ends by looking at the expanding world of commerce in the era of integration, as European merchants entrench their control of production and trade throughout the globe through their increased social and political importance, the spread of the putting-out system, and the refinement of colonial policies.

        "description": "When the 13th century author Ibn al-Adim from the city of Aleppo, Syria, titled his book on food Reaching the Beloved through the Description of Delicious Foods and Perfumes, he was perhaps not concerned so much with simply how to satisfy hunger. Thinking through the title alone opens a window for us on all sorts of cultural, social, economic, and political questions about food and drink. Our history as humans with food is long and complicated. It extends from seeking basic nutrition to sustain our livelihood to contracting diseases. Food also plays a fundamental role in how humans organize themselves in societies, differentiate socially, culturally, and economically, establish values and norms for religious, cultural, and communal practices, and define identities of race, gender, and class. Food has been one of the most visible signs of social status in any given society and a vital part of many movements of political and social reform and transformation. Food has been a major question in trans-regional, international, and recently global cooperation and conflict as well. This course will cover the history of food and drink in the Middle East to help us understand our complex relation with food and look at our lives from perspectives we intuitively feel or by implication know, but rarely critically and explicitly reflect on. This course does not intend to spoil, so to speak, this undeniably one of the most pleasurable human needs and activities, but rather to make you aware of how food shapes who we are as individuals and societies. We will study the history of food and drink in the Middle East across the centuries until the present time, but be selective in choosing themes, geographic regions, and historical periods to focus on. Course work is geared toward increasing your ability to think about food and drink analytically as a socio-economic and cultural capital, noticeable marker of identity, and indicator of a political position. In a sense we will try to tease out in class why we are what we eat! Please consult the instructor if you have not taken any course in the humanities.",

We will start with a brief introduction into the history of Iberian Jews prior to 1492, asking how this experience created a distinct subethnic Jewish group: the Sephardim. We will then follow their migratory path to North Africa, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and the Americas. The questions we will explore include: in what sense did Jews of Iberian heritage form a transnational community? How did they use their religious, cultural, and linguistic ties to advance their commercial interests? How did they transmit and transform aspects of Spanish culture and create a vibrant Ladino literature? How did the Sephardim interact with Ashkenazi, Greek, North African, and other Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities? How did Jewish emigres from Spain and Portugal become intermediaries between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire? What was the role of Sephardim in Europe's transatlantic expansion? How did conversos (converts to Christianity) return to Judaism and continue to grapple with their ambiguous religious identity? How did Ottoman and North African Jews respond to European cultural trends and colonialism and create their own unique forms of modern culture? How did the Holocaust impact Sephardic Jewry? The course will end with a discussion of the Sephardic experience in America and Israel today.",

How do modern historians use medieval documents to evoke the lives of men, women, and children who believed in magic or were accused of heresy?  Can this only be done through a form of historical anthropology?  What methods do historians use in trying to understand past ideas and practices? What is historical truth then?  What is the relationship of supposedly heterodox belief and behavior with religious orthodoxy?  How do we define religion?

By the end of the century, American historian and cultural critic Henry Adams argued there was indeed a \"religion of world's fairs.\" These international expositions, as sites of pilgrimages not only informed people's perception of the world but also were ideal stages for young countries to showcase their achievements, to attract investors and to craft a national identity. Students will examine the rise of exhibitionary culture and the construction of patriotic histories and national symbols, the manufacturing of racial ideologies and otherness, and how these were all embedded in debates on civilization, modernity and progress. Students will work on individual research projects using primary sources available for the 1904 Exhibition. Modern, Transregional.

At its core, it asks the question, what did it mean for the Jews of Central and Eastern Europe to emerge from small market towns and villages to confront modern ethnicities, nations, and empires? What lasting impact did the shtetl experience have on Jewish life in a rapidly changing environment? The focus is on the Jewish historical experience in the countries that make up Central and Eastern Europe (mainly the Bohemian lands, Hungary, Poland, and Russia) from the late eighteenth century to the fall of the Soviet Union. Among the topics that we will cover are: Jews and the nobility in Poland-Lithuania; the multi-cultural, imperial state; Hasidism and its opponents; absolutism and reform in imperial settings; the emergence of modern European nationalisms and their impact on Jewish identity; antisemitism and popular violence; nationalist and radical movements among Jews; war, revolution, and genocide; and the transition from Soviet dominion to democratic states.

It will begin in the fourth century after the conversion of Constantine the Great and end with the great witchcraft trials of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  The seminar will read magical treatises, ecclesiastical polemics against vulgar belief, inquisitorial trials, chronicles, and histories, in our attempt to define what was considered the ordinary and the extraordinary, the natural and the supernatural, good and evil, the boundaries of heaven and earth.  How do modern historians use medieval documents to evoke the lives of men, women, and children who believed in magic or were accused of heresy?  Can this only be done through a form of historical anthropology?  What methods do historians use in trying to understand past ideas and practices? What is historical truth then?  What is the relationship of supposedly heterodox belief and behavior with religious orthodoxy?  How do we define religion?  A theme throughout this seminar will be the definition of evil and the powers of the devil. Students will write a short historiographic essay and a long research essay. Pre-modern, Europe.

More than a third of the semester will be dedicated to the Jewish experience in modern Europe, the US, and Israel. We will get to know some of the major literary works that Jews produced and studied and learn to understand them as both expressions of Jewish identity and responses to specific historical circumstances. The course, furthermore, aims to challenge widespread stereotypes of Jewish history, such as its \"lachrymose conception\" (Salo W. Baron) as a mere series of suffering and persecution. By contrast, we will investigate when and how Jews were actors in their own right and actively engaged with other cultures, religions, and social groups.

        "description": "America has often been celebrated as \"a nation of immigrants\" - a narrative that commonly emphasizes earlier pathways of Western European heritage rather than later pathways of Asians, and largely overlooks the experiences of colonized, indigenous people such as Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians.  The challenges faced by Asians and Pacific Islanders in their Americanization pathway varied significantly not only from those of their European counterparts, but also from one another, making their experiences especially worthy of study.  Americans with Asian, Hawaiian, and Pacific Island heritage are at the core of a massive demographic and cultural shift that is profoundly reshaping the contours of American society today.  They remain the most diverse of all ethnic and racial groups, with Asian immigrants only enhancing this diversity.   \n\nThis multidisciplinary course will explore Asian and Pacific Island American experiences past and present, highlighting intersectional connections with social class, race, ethnicity, gender, and religion that forge identify formation and contribute to extensive social change. This intersection focuses on categories that privilege some Asian groups but put others at risk for social disadvantage.  We will be guided by sociological perspectives but draw heavily on sources from history, political science, social psychology, and Asian American studies, interweaving narratives that feature both similarities and differences among  Asian Americans, Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.  Capitalizing on  \"Asian\"  St. Louis as a fertile setting for our exploration,  we will welcome visitors from organizations representing  Asian American interests as they share perspectives on how Asian heritage  continues to define, circumscribe, or enhance opportunities for their constituencies.",

During the first half of the semester, we explore these historical relationships and examine the scientific constructs of race in the 19th and early 20th century. We touch on themes that defined the colonial encounter, including the development of the Four Communes in Senegal, the Negritude movement, and French Islamic policies in Africa. The curriculum for this course includes articles, films, and monographs, to explore these themes and includes writers and social activists living in France and the African diaspora. The second half of the course examines Francophone Africa after independence.  Here the course explores the political and cultural (inter) dependence between France and its Francophone African partners. In addition, we examine the challenges of many African states to respond to their citizen's needs, as well as France's changing immigration policies in the 1980s, followed by the devaluation of the West and Central African Franc (CFA).",

This was one of the most tumultuous centuries in Chinese history, during which China faced threats from abroad in the form of Western and Japanese imperialism, and from within, in the form of environmental degradation and rebellions resulting in an unprecedented loss of human life. The nineteenth century has thus often been portrayed as a period of sharp decline for China. At the same time, we will explore the ways in which the origins of the dynamic society and economy found in China today, as well as the worldwide influence of overseas Chinese, can be traced to this century of turmoil.

The course begins by defining the basic institutions and structures of the medieval Mediterranean, such as banking and credit operations, trading partnerships, and the position of the merchant within Renaissance society. The focus then shifts to merchant capital in an era of centralization, as the Dutch develop their world trade hegemony and the increasingly centralized states support of monopoly companies and mercantilist policies. The course ends by looking at the expanding world of commerce in the era of integration, as European merchants entrench their control of production and trade throughout the globe through their increased social and political importance, the spread of the putting-out system, and the refinement of colonial policies.

        "description": "For centuries, Indians, Chinese, Jews, Malays, Arabs, Portuguese, Africans, Americans, English and a fascinating medley of other peoples have been circulating freely in the Indian Ocean as merchants, pirates, explorers, missionaries and pilgrims. From the Horn of Africa to Indonesia, the Indian Ocean has long witnessed a frantic exchange that cut across ethnic and language affiliations. We begin by exploring the early history of the Indian Ocean up till the 18th century. We then trace the spread of Islam in the region which has been dubbed the 'Muslim Lake.' Next, we focus on the consequences of increased European presence in the Indian Ocean from the late 18th century onwards. What effects did European imperial expansion have on Indian Ocean trade, migration patterns and the religious haj pilgrimage? Vivid travel narratives provided by Joseph Conrad and Amitav Ghosh challenge historical periodization that neatly divides world history into pre-colonial and colonial eras. During the 19th century, both Europeans and Asians, traders, migrants and haj pilgrims alike, travelled extensively across the Indian Ocean as before, albeit at a faster rate and in much greater numbers. This period coincided with the intensification of Indian and Arab migration to Southeast Asia. How did the advent of colonialism accompanied by immense technological development in the 19th century actually affect the political and economic relations in the Indian Ocean? We round off the semester with sections of Robert Kaplan's seminal book on contemporary politics in the Indian Ocean. How relevant is Islam during the 21st century?",

It examines the major personalities, complex ideas, vexing controversies, and diverse movements associated with anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-communism, individualist anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism, anarchist feminism, green anarchism, lifestyle anarchism, and poststructuralist anarchism.  In doing so, it explores traditional anarchist concerns with state power, authority, social inequality, capitalism, nationalism, imperialism, and militarism.  It also analyzes anarchism's conception of individual and collective liberation, mutual aid, workers' organization, internationalism, direct democracy, education, women's emancipation, sexual freedom, and social ecology.

In addition to this ancient focus, the course aims to relate many of the most historically durable characteristics of the region to contemporary developments of the past two or three centuries.  Fundamentally, this course asks us to reconceptualize the notion of \"civilization\" from the perspective of societies whose dominant forms of organization defied typical classifications such as \"states\" or \"empires\" and, instead, shaped a wholly different social order over the past 5000 years or more.  This class provides a well-rounded experience of the geography, social organization, and social interconnections of one of the most essential and pivotal regions in world history and contemporary political discourse.",

        "description": "Whether read as psychological thriller, spiritual journey, or social polemic, Dostoevsky's 1866 novel CRIME AND PUNISHMENT has inspired diverse artistic responses around the world. From the nineteenth century to the present day, writers and filmmakers have revisited (and often subverted) questions that Dostoevsky's novel poses: What internal and external forces cause someone to \"step over\" into crime? What are the implications of a confession? To what extent can the legal system provide a just punishment? Are forgiveness and redemption possible, or even relevant? What role does grace--or luck--play in the entire process?  This course begins with our close reading of Dostoevsky's novel and then moves on to short stories, novels, literary essays, and movies that engage in dialogue with the Russian predecessor. A central concern of our intertextual approach is to explore the interplay between specific socio-historical contexts and universal questions. All readings are in English. No prerequisites.",

        "description": "While oil and violent conflict structure contemporary accounts and imaginaries of the Middle East, less attention is paid to the kinds of environments that capitalist extraction, imperialist ideologies, and militarized struggles over land and power produce in the Middle East and to the slow forms of violent they inflict on humans and non-humans alike. How have ideas about Middle Eastern environments-as barren desert or as fertile crescent-given rise to particular kinds of violent practices, contaminated places, and degraded lives? In what ways has environmental transformation been both the target and effect of (post)colonial, capitalist, and state projects across the Middle East?  And how do people actually inhabit, represent, and resist these violent processes? To answer these questions, we approach violence through postcolonial theorist Rob Nixon's concept of slow violence. Against the assumption that violence is fast and spectacular, slow violence is the gradual and unevenly dispersed violence of global climate change, of fossil fuel dependency, and of toxic remnants of war. From the oil fields and desalination plants of Saudi Arabia to the \"blooming\" desert of Israel to the dried up river beds of Syria to the cluster bomb fields of Lebanon, we survey slow violence in the Middle East to understand the conditions that produced it, how it transforms the environment, and its racialized and gendered distributions. At the same time, we attend to the voices that inhabit the environments produced by slow violence to better understand how the multiple and overlapping temporalites of violence are lived in and the kinds of futures that are imagined and demanded.

This course explores the evolving relationship between science and art from the late eighteenth through twenty-first centuries, with a focus on literature and film. Our inquiry will be guided by a series of questions: how does scientific inquiry shape art? How have aesthetic philosophies influenced attitudes towards science? Is there such a thing as the \"literary experiment,\" and what sets it apart from a scientific one? Finally, where does science fiction fit in? Through close readings of our primary \"texts,\" we will explore artistic attempts to explore, expand, or refute paradigms of scientific thought in aesthetic terms. Readings include Goethe, Hoffmann, Lasswitz, D\u00f6blin, Broch, Musil, Dath. Visual sources include Lang, Fassbinder, and Kluge. Readings and discussion in German.",

Focusing on inter-state and transnational relations, it seeks to historically contextualize and analyze long term patterns and trends between Latin American states and between Latin America and the United States, Europe, and the global South. Given Latin America's shared experience with imperialism and more recently with neo-imperialism, special attention will be paid to the ways Latin America has sought to manage and/or resist foreign domination, especially U.S. hegemonic pretensions. To this end it will analyze patterns of inter-American conflict and cooperation. When, why, and under what conditions Latin America articulated an independent foreign policy, forged anti-imperialist blocs, embraced U.S. sponsored diplomatic efforts and military alliances, and pursued Latin American unity and solidarity will be closely examined. To better understand the continuities, discontinuities, contradictions, and complexities of Latin American foreign policy, this course will also assess the influence of changing regional and national political cultures from both a theoretical and a historical perspective. In doing so, it explores how elite culture, the balance of domestic social forces, ideological and economic development, and shared cultural identities and meanings informed national political cultures and how these in turn shaped Latin American foreign policies.",

Melodrama has variously been defined as a genre, a logic, an affect, and a mode, applied to diverse media, divergent cultural traditions, and different historical contexts. The course provides a survey of East Asian melodrama films-as well as films that challenge conventional definitions of melodrama-by pairing Japanese, Korean, and Chinese-language productions with key critical texts in melodrama studies. We will see classics such as Tokyo Story, Two Stage Sisters, and The Housemaid. We will examine melodrama's complex ties to modernity, tradition, and cultural transformation in East Asia; special emphasis will be placed on representations of the family, historical change, gender, and sexuality. In addition to historical background and film studies concepts, we will also consider a range of approaches for thinking about the aesthetics and politics of emotion. No prerequisites.

We will investigate-and with our authors question-what have come to be seen as the conventions of Irish narrative in the 20th century that are, in part, legacies of centuries-old Irish-language traditions:  discontinuous storylines, unstable boundaries between places, temporalities, and personalities, and a delight in the sounding, invention, and confusion of names and words.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, one theme that binds these Irish texts is secrecy and, as its corollary, suspicion, with espionage or surveillance and its coded language-a version of Joyce's phrase \"exile and cunning-an explicit plotline . Texts include \"Picture of Dorian Gray\" (Oscar Wilde), poems, stories, and essays by W. B.Yeats and Louis MacNeice, \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" (James Joyce), \"The Heat of the Day\" (Elizabeth Bowen),  \"At Swim-Two-Birds\" (Flann O'Brien), and excerpts from Samuel Beckett's late-career \"closed space\" tales \"Nohow On.\"  Texts by contemporary Irish writers include \"The Untouchable\" (John Banville), poems and essays by Eil\u00e9an N\u00ed Chuillean\u00e1in, and Ciaran Carson's multi-generic \"Belfast Confetti,\" excerptions from his translation of the Irish-language epic \"The Tain,\" and his sci-fi folk tale \"Shamrock Tea.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

In tracing the outlines of Hitchcock's long career, we will pair seven of his greatest films with the films and film theories they inspired, many of them reflecting the critical and creative legacy of feminist and queer theory.  In each pairing, the contemporary film is, in some way, a critical revision of Hitchcock's original, one that is revelatory of Hitchcock's brilliance and blindnesses.  Pairings will likely include Psycho with Harron's American Psycho, Rebecca with Jane Campion's The Piano,  Rear Window with Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty, Vertigo with Fincher's Gone Girl.  By the end of the course, students will have a deep understanding of the way that Hitchcock's movies live on in the visual culture we see around us and the ways we have learned to see it.

Global phenomena such as expanding world trade, international labor markets, industrialization, urbanization, colonialism, imperialism, capital and labor mobility, and the spread of radical ideologies will be analyzed to assess their impact on the nature of work, labor relations systems, labor organization, and workers' collective action. \n \nThis course will introduce students to key topics and themes in global labor history. These themes are varied and complex and range from working-class formation, immigration, state-labor relations,  labor regimes, patterns of racialized and gendered work, competing labor ideologies, and transnational and transcontinental relations between workers in different regions of the world.  The history of Latin American workers and labor movements will receive special attention.",

        "description": "This course provides an in-depth examination of the geographies of violence in Central America. As a region frequently characterized as endemically prone to violence, it is vital to analyze and contextualize the violence. Approaching violence in Central America from a geographic perspective involves not only locating and \"placing\" the violence, but also thinking relationally about the multiple, overlapping scales of activity, both within and beyond the region. The course is divided into five parts. In the first two sections of the course, we begin with an overview of the physical and human geography of the region and outline key historic moments and their legacies, including colonization, international relations (with an emphasis on U.S. interventions), civil war, genocide and torture. Simultaneously, we delve into various theoretical approaches for understanding the nature of multiple types of violence. In the third section of the course, we focus on neoliberal violence, insecurity and development and address issues such as urbanization, violent crime, issues with free trade and labor, and environmental issues. For the final two sections, we draw from contemporary case studies in the region (reading the four required books noted above). We will address identity and violence (discussing indigenous issues, racism, genocide and gender) and in the last section we will cover migration, gangs, drug-trafficking, U.S. security responses, and re-militarization. While we will continue to consider these types of violence through the various theoretical frameworks introduced in the first part of the course, we will also examine and analyze reports on contemporary violence and policy recommendations from multiple sources (multilateral organizations, governments, think tanks, and other nongovernmental organizations). Throughout the course we will also discuss current events occurring in Central America and how they directly or indirectly relate to the topic of geographies of violence.",

We will consider cultural output as a means of both upholding and subverting traditional values, focusing particularly on representations of love, sex, and gender in the \"floating world\" of the pleasure quarters, images of samurai honor, stories of ghosts and the supernatural, and nascent ideas about national identity.

We will also consider the fundamental role that interpretation plays in religious communities: Once books become regarded as Scripture, how do they take on new meanings for their various readers as they are transmitted into different places, eras, and cultures?

        "description": "Much operatic repertoire is based on classics of literature, from the very first operas of 1598-1600 to the present day. From Literature to Opera will introduce students to the world of opera through a close study of a few select works based on major literary subjects, beginning with the literary works themselves and proceeding to the ways the texts are adapted for the musical stage and then transformed into another genre through their dramatic musical settings. For 2018 the works studied will be Virgil's and Ovid's versions of the Orpheus myth set to music by Claudio Monteverdi in 1607 as one of the earliest operas. Next we will move on to Carlo Goldoni's play, \"Don Juan\" which was composed by Mozart as \"Don Giovanni\" in 1787. Shakespeare will be represented by the ultimate tragedy of words, \"Othello,\" and Giuseppe Verdi's \"Otello\" of 1887. The course will conclude with Claude Debussy's \"P\u00e9lleas et M\u00e9lisande\" of 1902, based on Maurice Maeterlinck's 1892 symbolist play of the same name.  No previous musical experience required. The class will be conducted as a seminar focused on student participation. Each student will also choose an opera based on a literary work as the subject of two 10-page papers. The first, due at midterm, will study the literary source and the way it is adapted as an operatic text (libretto). The second, due at the end of finals week, will analyze how the libretto is dramatized through the music. One of the important purposes of class discussion will be to develop a usable vocabulary for describing music and its dramatic effects.",

What can psychoanalytic readings tell us more broadly about the act of reading? How can psychoanalysis enrich our sense of the ethical import of reading and writing, and how can literature challenge psychoanalytic goals and values?  Our main psychoanalytic authors will be Freud, Ernest Jones, Klein, Lacan, and Winnicott. Literary readings will range widely from Sophocles and Shakespeare to Henry James and Alison Bechdel.",

We will visit Venice, Bologna, Florence and Rome, where we will explore attractions typical of the Tour. Coffee houses proliferated in the eighteenth century and, similar to their function today, were centers of social life. Theaters, concert halls, gaming houses, literary and scientific academies, galleries, churches, and universities will be part of the standardized itinerary we will follow. The piazza, the hub of Italian life, where Italians and their foreign guests gathered for Carnival masquerades, criminal executions, religious and civic festivals will be a key stop in select cities. We will visit archeological excavation sites, in particular Pompeii, first unearthed in 1748. Fashion, an obsessive preoccupation of the day, will also be a point of interest. We will examine one of the most remarkable aspects of Italian culture of the period, the authority of Italian women, authority unmatched anywhere else in Europe at the time. Readings will be a mix of primary and secondary texts. Prereq: at least one 300-level literature course. Readings in Italian or English.",

        "description": "Excessive emotion, unreasonable sacrifice, hidden truth, untimely knowledge, and forbidden desire-the power of melodrama and its moving representations have fueled the popularity of hundreds, if not thousands, of books, plays, and films. Melodrama has variously been defined as a genre, a logic, an affect, and a mode, applied to diverse media, divergent cultural traditions, and different historical contexts. The course provides a survey of East Asian melodrama films-as well as films that challenge conventional definitions of melodrama-by pairing Japanese, Korean, and Chinese-language productions with key critical texts in melodrama studies. We will see classics such as Tokyo Story, Two Stage Sisters, and The Housemaid. We will examine melodrama's complex ties to modernity, tradition, and cultural transformation in East Asia; special emphasis will be placed on representations of the family, historical change, gender, and sexuality. In addition to historical background and film studies concepts, we will also consider a range of approaches for thinking about the aesthetics and politics of emotion. No prerequisites. No prior knowledge of East Asian culture or language necessary. REQUIRED SCREENING: Wednesdays @ 4pm",

We will consider cultural output as a means of both upholding and subverting traditional values, focusing particularly on representations of love, sex, and gender in the \"floating world\" of the pleasure quarters, images of samurai honor, stories of ghosts and the supernatural, and nascent ideas about national identity.  When relevant, we will also consider images of early modern Japan in modern literature and film.   Readings will be in English translation.

More than a third of the semester will be dedicated to the Jewish experience in modern Europe, the US, and Israel. We will get to know some of the major literary works that Jews produced and studied and learn to understand them as both expressions of Jewish identity and responses to specific historical circumstances. The course, furthermore, aims to challenge widespread stereotypes of Jewish history, such as its \"lachrymose conception\" (Salo W. Baron) as a mere series of suffering and persecution. By contrast, we will investigate when and how Jews were actors in their own right and actively engaged with other cultures, religions, and social groups. Prior study or knowledge of Judaism is not a prerequisite for taking this course.",

        "description": "\"Out of the Shtetl\" is a course about tradition and transformation; small towns and urban centers; ethnicity and citizenship; nations, states, and empires. At its core, it asks the question, what did it mean for the Jews of Central and Eastern Europe to emerge from small market towns and villages to confront modern ethnicities, nations, and empires? What lasting impact did the shtetl experience have on Jewish life in a rapidly changing environment? The focus is on the Jewish historical experience in the countries that make up Central and Eastern Europe (mainly the Bohemian lands, Hungary, Poland, and Russia) from the late eighteenth century to the fall of the Soviet Union. Among the topics that we will cover are: Jews and the nobility in Poland-Lithuania; the multi-cultural, imperial state; Hasidism and its opponents; absolutism and reform in imperial settings; the emergence of modern European nationalisms and their impact on Jewish identity; antisemitism and popular violence; nationalist and radical movements among Jews; war, revolution, and genocide; and the transition from Soviet dominion to democratic states. Modern, Europe. PREREQUISITE: Sophomore standing or permission of the instructor.",

        "description": "For centuries, Indians, Chinese, Jews, Malays, Arabs, Portuguese, Africans, Americans, English and a fascinating medley of other peoples have been circulating freely in the Indian Ocean as merchants, pirates, explorers, missionaries and pilgrims. From the Horn of Africa to Indonesia, the Indian Ocean has long witnessed a frantic exchange that cut across ethnic and language affiliations. We begin by exploring the early history of the Indian Ocean up till the 18th century. We then trace the spread of Islam in the region which has been dubbed the 'Muslim Lake.' Next, we focus on the consequences of increased European presence in the Indian Ocean from the late 18th century onwards. What effects did European imperial expansion have on Indian Ocean trade, migration patterns and the religious haj pilgrimage? Vivid travel narratives provided by Joseph Conrad and Amitav Ghosh challenge historical periodization that neatly divides world history into pre-colonial and colonial eras. During the 19th century, both Europeans and Asians, traders, migrants and haj pilgrims alike, travelled extensively across the Indian Ocean as before, albeit at a faster rate and in much greater numbers. This period coincided with the intensification of Indian and Arab migration to Southeast Asia. How did the advent of colonialism accompanied by immense technological development in the 19th century actually affect the political and economic relations in the Indian Ocean? We round off the semester with sections of Robert Kaplan's seminal book on contemporary politics in the Indian Ocean. How relevant is Islam during the 21st century?",

We will start with a brief introduction into the history of Iberian Jews prior to 1492, asking how this experience created a distinct subethnic Jewish group: the Sephardim. We will then follow their migratory path to North Africa, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and the Americas. The questions we will explore include: in what sense did Jews of Iberian heritage form a transnational community? How did they use their religious, cultural, and linguistic ties to advance their commercial interests? How did they transmit and transform aspects of Spanish culture and create a vibrant Ladino literature? How did the Sephardim interact with Ashkenazi, Greek, North African, and other Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities? How did Jewish emigres from Spain and Portugal become intermediaries between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire? What was the role of Sephardim in Europe's transatlantic expansion? How did conversos (converts to Christianity) return to Judaism and continue to grapple with their ambiguous religious identity? How did Ottoman and North African Jews respond to European cultural trends and colonialism and create their own unique forms of modern culture? How did the Holocaust impact Sephardic Jewry? The course will end with a discussion of the Sephardic experience in America and Israel today.",

        "description": "When the 13th century author Ibn al-Adim from the city of Aleppo, Syria, titled his book on food Reaching the Beloved through the Description of Delicious Foods and Perfumes, he was perhaps not concerned so much with simply how to satisfy hunger. Thinking through the title alone opens a window for us on all sorts of cultural, social, economic, and political questions about food and drink. Our history as humans with food is long and complicated. It extends from seeking basic nutrition to sustain our livelihood to contracting diseases. Food also plays a fundamental role in how humans organize themselves in societies, differentiate socially, culturally, and economically, establish values and norms for religious, cultural, and communal practices, and define identities of race, gender, and class. Food has been one of the most visible signs of social status in any given society and a vital part of many movements of political and social reform and transformation. Food has been a major question in trans-regional, international, and recently global cooperation and conflict as well. This course will cover the history of food and drink in the Middle East to help us understand our complex relation with food and look at our lives from perspectives we intuitively feel or by implication know, but rarely critically and explicitly reflect on. This course does not intend to spoil, so to speak, this undeniably one of the most pleasurable human needs and activities, but rather to make you aware of how food shapes who we are as individuals and societies. We will study the history of food and drink in the Middle East across the centuries until the present time, but be selective in choosing themes, geographic regions, and historical periods to focus on. Course work is geared toward increasing your ability to think about food and drink analytically as a socio-economic and cultural capital, noticeable marker of identity, and indicator of a political position. In a sense we will try to tease out in class why we are what we eat! Please consult the instructor if you have not taken any course in the humanities.",

        "description": "While oil and violent conflict structure contemporary accounts and imaginaries of the Middle East, less attention is paid to the kinds of environments that capitalist extraction, imperialist ideologies, and militarized struggles over land and power produce in the Middle East and to the slow forms of violent they inflict on humans and non-humans alike. How have ideas about Middle Eastern environments-as barren desert or as fertile crescent-given rise to particular kinds of violent practices, contaminated places, and degraded lives? In what ways has environmental transformation been both the target and effect of (post)colonial, capitalist, and state projects across the Middle East?  And how do people actually inhabit, represent, and resist these violent processes? To answer these questions, we approach violence through postcolonial theorist Rob Nixon's concept of slow violence. Against the assumption that violence is fast and spectacular, slow violence is the gradual and unevenly dispersed violence of global climate change, of fossil fuel dependency, and of toxic remnants of war. From the oil fields and desalination plants of Saudi Arabia to the \"blooming\" desert of Israel to the dried up river beds of Syria to the cluster bomb fields of Lebanon, we survey slow violence in the Middle East to understand the conditions that produced it, how it transforms the environment, and its racialized and gendered distributions. At the same time, we attend to the voices that inhabit the environments produced by slow violence to better understand how the multiple and overlapping temporalites of violence are lived in and the kinds of futures that are imagined and demanded.

What lasting impact did the shtetl experience have on Jewish life in a rapidly changing environment? The focus is on the Jewish historical experience in the countries that make up Central and Eastern Europe (mainly the Bohemian lands, Hungary, Poland, and Russia) from the late eighteenth century to the fall of the Soviet Union. Among the topics that we will cover are: Jews and the nobility in Poland-Lithuania; the multi-cultural, imperial state; Hasidism and its opponents; absolutism and reform in imperial settings; the emergence of modern European nationalisms and their impact on Jewish identity; antisemitism and popular violence; nationalist and radical movements among Jews; war, revolution, and genocide; and the transition from Soviet dominion to democratic states.

        "description": "For centuries, Indians, Chinese, Jews, Malays, Arabs, Portuguese, Africans, Americans, English and a fascinating medley of other peoples have been circulating freely in the Indian Ocean as merchants, pirates, explorers, missionaries and pilgrims. From the Horn of Africa to Indonesia, the Indian Ocean has long witnessed a frantic exchange that cut across ethnic and language affiliations. We begin by exploring the early history of the Indian Ocean up till the 18th century. We then trace the spread of Islam in the region which has been dubbed the 'Muslim Lake.' Next, we focus on the consequences of increased European presence in the Indian Ocean from the late 18th century onwards. What effects did European imperial expansion have on Indian Ocean trade, migration patterns and the religious haj pilgrimage? Vivid travel narratives provided by Joseph Conrad and Amitav Ghosh challenge historical periodization that neatly divides world history into pre-colonial and colonial eras. During the 19th century, both Europeans and Asians, traders, migrants and haj pilgrims alike, travelled extensively across the Indian Ocean as before, albeit at a faster rate and in much greater numbers. This period coincided with the intensification of Indian and Arab migration to Southeast Asia. How did the advent of colonialism accompanied by immense technological development in the 19th century actually affect the political and economic relations in the Indian Ocean? We round off the semester with sections of Robert Kaplan's seminal book on contemporary politics in the Indian Ocean. How relevant is Islam during the 21st century?",

We will start with a brief introduction into the history of Iberian Jews prior to 1492, asking how this experience created a distinct subethnic Jewish group: the Sephardim. We will then follow their migratory path to North Africa, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and the Americas. The questions we will explore include: in what sense did Jews of Iberian heritage form a transnational community? How did they use their religious, cultural, and linguistic ties to advance their commercial interests? How did they transmit and transform aspects of Spanish culture and create a vibrant Ladino literature? How did the Sephardim interact with Ashkenazi, Greek, North African, and other Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities? How did Jewish emigres from Spain and Portugal become intermediaries between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire? What was the role of Sephardim in Europe's transatlantic expansion? How did conversos (converts to Christianity) return to Judaism and continue to grapple with their ambiguous religious identity? How did Ottoman and North African Jews respond to European cultural trends and colonialism and create their own unique forms of modern culture? How did the Holocaust impact Sephardic Jewry? The course will end with a discussion of the Sephardic experience in America and Israel today.",

How do these formations and changes relate to literary and cinematic portraits of gender on one hand and to gendered conceptions of literature and cinema on the other? How do socio-historical circumstances affect representations of gender?  All readings are in English.

Focusing on inter-state and transnational relations, it seeks to historically contextualize and analyze long term patterns and trends between Latin American states and between Latin America and the United States, Europe, and the global South. Given Latin America's shared experience with imperialism and more recently with neo-imperialism, special attention will be paid to the ways Latin America has sought to manage and/or resist foreign domination, especially U.S. hegemonic pretensions. To this end it will analyze patterns of inter-American conflict and cooperation. When, why, and under what conditions Latin America articulated an independent foreign policy, forged anti-imperialist blocs, embraced U.S. sponsored diplomatic efforts and military alliances, and pursued Latin American unity and solidarity will be closely examined. To better understand the continuities, discontinuities, contradictions, and complexities of Latin American foreign policy, this course will also assess the influence of changing regional and national political cultures from both a theoretical and a historical perspective. In doing so, it explores how elite culture, the balance of domestic social forces, ideological and economic development, and shared cultural identities and meanings informed national political cultures and how these in turn shaped Latin American foreign policies.",

        "description": "This course provides an in-depth examination of the geographies of violence in Central America. As a region frequently characterized as endemically prone to violence, it is vital to analyze and contextualize the violence. Approaching violence in Central America from a geographic perspective involves not only locating and \"placing\" the violence, but also thinking relationally about the multiple, overlapping scales of activity, both within and beyond the region. The course is divided into five parts. In the first two sections of the course, we begin with an overview of the physical and human geography of the region and outline key historic moments and their legacies, including colonization, international relations (with an emphasis on U.S. interventions), civil war, genocide and torture. Simultaneously, we delve into various theoretical approaches for understanding the nature of multiple types of violence. In the third section of the course, we focus on neoliberal violence, insecurity and development and address issues such as urbanization, violent crime, issues with free trade and labor, and environmental issues. For the final two sections, we draw from contemporary case studies in the region (reading the four required books noted above). We will address identity and violence (discussing indigenous issues, racism, genocide and gender) and in the last section we will cover migration, gangs, drug-trafficking, U.S. security responses, and re-militarization. While we will continue to consider these types of violence through the various theoretical frameworks introduced in the first part of the course, we will also examine and analyze reports on contemporary violence and policy recommendations from multiple sources (multilateral organizations, governments, think tanks, and other nongovernmental organizations). Throughout the course we will also discuss current events occurring in Central America and how they directly or indirectly relate to the topic of geographies of violence.",

We will read a large sampling of satiric verse in the original Latin, practice reading the dactylic hexameter, and observe and discuss differences between the poets' styles and themes. We'll also read and discuss scholarship on the genre's formal characteristics and influences, its origins in Republican literary culture, and its development in the Imperial period.

Playing legally necessary roles, like \"judge\" or \"defense attorney,\" can involve attacking the innocent and protecting the guilty.  How can we draw the line between laws that acceptably interfere with our lives and those that don't?  When, why, and how should we enforce the law?  To what extent are actions within the law exempt from ordinary moral criticisms?  In this class, you will learn to think well about these questions.

        "description": "Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students from all academic disciplines (and with any post-graduate plan) to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police. \n\n\nPrerequisite: sophomore standing or higher; preference given to upper-level students on the waitlist.  Not a prerequisite at all:  any interest, let alone intention, to attend law school.",

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (or women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women. Over the years, this course has attracted WGSS students and pre-law students. This course is taught by law students under the supervision of a member of the School of Law faculty.

From the nineteenth century to the present day, writers and filmmakers have revisited (and often subverted) questions that Dostoevsky's novel poses: What internal and external forces cause someone to \"step over\" into crime? What are the implications of a confession? To what extent can the legal system provide a just punishment? Are forgiveness and redemption possible, or even relevant? What role does grace--or luck--play in the entire process?  This course begins with our close reading of Dostoevsky's novel and then moves on to short stories, novels, literary essays, and movies that engage in dialogue with the Russian predecessor. A central concern of our intertextual approach is to explore the interplay between specific socio-historical contexts and universal questions. All readings are in English. No prerequisites.",

Works responding to the devastating plagues in the medieval and early modern periods hold especial interest for those studying illness and medicine; we will read works on plague by Boccaccio, Chaucer, and Defoe, with Sontag's Illness as Metaphor providing a starting point for our analysis. Two twentieth-century novels-The Plague, by Camus, and Blindness, by Jos\u00e9 Saramago-will show us the additional imaginative possibilities of plague as metaphor and allegory. We will also read shorter works of fiction by Tolstoy, Mann, Chekhov, Eliot, Gilman, and Porter, as well as Edson's play Wit.

In this course, we will explore the world of medieval love-from the chivalrous and courtly to the bodily and obscene-as represented in books of songs from the fifteenth century. Scrumptiously decorated and preserved, five interrelated songbooks from central France, known as the \"Loire Valley Chansonniers\" contain the majority of love songs from this period. Working from digitized versions of the songbooks, online editions, and modern audio recordings, we will address the following questions: what do the songbooks tell us about the culture in which they were created? How do the graphic decorations that frame each song interact with its music and lyrics? Lastly, by contextualizing these digital sources with respect to the growing interest in the interface between the humanities and digital technology, we will discuss what we can gain from these developments and what-if anything-we stand to lose.

We will begin in the nineteenth century, a particularly vibrant period in the history of virtuosity. Several generations of performers inspired unprecedented public fascination, produced a rich repertoire of showpieces, and in many cases reinvented what was considered possible in performance. However, our course will continue well into the twentieth century. Assignments include weekly readings and spirited discussion, occasional presentations, and a final research project on a topic of the student's choosing.

        "description": "Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students from all academic disciplines (and with any post-graduate plan) to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police. \n\n\nPrerequisite: sophomore standing or higher; preference given to upper-level students on the waitlist.  Not a prerequisite at all:  any interest, let alone intention, to attend law school.",

We begin with basic foundational issues in classical logic, including the relation of logic to psychological reasoning and Tarski's definition of logical consequence, and gradually go on to consider the motivations and status of well-known extensions (sometimes regarded as 'neo-classical' logics) such as modal logics and second-order logic.  In the last weeks of the course, we'll examine some outright challengers, including intuitionistic and paraconsistent logics. After evaluating the arguments for and against these challenges, we'll examine one recent, controversial view-logical pluralism-which suggests that we might not need to choose among the rival systems.\n Many of the readings for this course are classics of contemporary philosophy, and the subject is likely to be of especial interest to students who have interests in logic, and in the philosophy and foundations of mathematics and language.\n Some of the important ideas in the course presuppose at least a basic acquaintance with formal logic, and hence either Phil 100 or Phil 301 (or permission of the instructor) are prerequisites.",

In the last weeks of the course, we'll examine some outright challengers, including intuitionistic and paraconsistent logics. After evaluating the arguments for and against these challenges, we'll examine one recent, controversial view-logical pluralism-which suggests that we might not need to choose among the rival systems.\n Many of the readings for this course are classics of contemporary philosophy, and the subject is likely to be of especial interest to students who have interests in logic, and in the philosophy and foundations of mathematics and language.\n Some of the important ideas in the course presuppose at least a basic acquaintance with formal logic, and hence either Phil 100 or Phil 301 (or permission of the instructor) are prerequisites.",

And so, according to some philosophers, cognitive science has the potential to seriously threaten a range of our ordinary metaphysical beliefs and undermine projects in metaphysics that take ordinary metaphysical beliefs seriously.  We will examine these recent developments at the intersection of cognitive science and metaphysics.  Focusing on select topics-such as time, causation, persistence, etc.-where cognitive science has been connected to metaphysics, special attention will be paid to attempts to debunk or undermine metaphysical beliefs.  \n\nPrerequisite: A 300 level Philosophy course (Phil/PNP 315 is recommended); and PNP major with last Junior semester or Senior standing.

In other words, instead of putting emphasis on what textbook writers think political scientist know, in this course the emphasis is on \"how we know what we know\" and on building knowledge. This approach equips students with a set of tools to use long after the course is over. These comparative tools are focused on historical, recent, and current events, and students are provided the opportunity to delve more deeply into a study of the parts of the world most they find most interesting.",

        "description": "Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students from all academic disciplines (and with any post-graduate plan) to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police. \n\n\nPrerequisite: sophomore standing or higher; preference given to upper-level students on the waitlist.  Not a prerequisite at all:  any interest, let alone intention, to attend law school.",

        "description": "Statistical computing is a quickly changing field.  Standard techniques of today would have been difficult to execute fifteen years ago and impossible in the early 1990s.  Rapid improvements i computing power have been accompanied by swift changes in standard statistical methods.  In just the last decade, techniques ranging from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, randomization inference, network analysis, and non-parametric matching have moved from being novel, advanced applications to commonplace across the social sciences.\n\nThis class is designed to achieve two broad objectives.  More narrowly, it aims to guide students as they learn the specifics of the R programming language, a powerful statistical computing environment widely used in the fields of political science, network analysis, machine learning, and statistics.  Achieving this goal will require students to learn commands, best practices, and work-arounds specific to the sometimes idiosyncratic R language.",

        "description": "The goal of this course is to help students in the CCSN Pathway develop the critical thinking skills necessary to develop and implement high quality, interdisciplinary research projects.  Throughout the course of the semester, each student will develop a research plan in their chosen area of interest.  The plan will be developed in consultation with at least two faculty members (from at least two different subdisciplines within the pathway) as well as the other students and faculty participating in the course.  The culmination of this course will be for each student to produce an NIH-style grant proposal on the research project of their choosing.  For most students, this will serve either as their thesis proposal or a solid precursor to the thesis proposal. The course will be designed to help facilitate the development of such a research plan through didactic work, class presentations, class discussion, and constructive feedback on written work.  The course will begin with a review of written examples of outstanding research proposals, primarily in the form of grant submissions similar to those that the students are expected to develop (i.e., NRSA style proposals, R03 proposals).  Review of these proposals will serve as a stimulus to promote discussion about the critical elements of good research proposals and designs in different areas. Each student will be expected to give three presentations throughout the semester that will provide opportunities to receive constructive feedback on the development and implementation of research aims.  The first presentation (towards the beginning of the semester) will involve presentation of the student's general topic of interest and preliminary formulation of research questions.  Feedback will emphasize ways to focus and develop the research hypotheses into well-formulated questions and experiments.  The second presentation will involve a more detailed presentation of specific research questions (along the lines of NIH-style Specific Aims) and an initial outline of research methods.  The final presentation will involve a fuller presentation of research questions and proposed methods.  Feedback, didactic work, and group discussion throughout the semester will include guidance on critical components of the development of a research plan, including how to perform literature searches, formulate testable hypotheses, write critical literature summaries, and design experiments and analyses.  The course will meet once a week, with faculty members from different tracks within the Pathway present at each meeting.  This will allow students to receive feedback from several perspectives.

We will get to know some of the major literary works that Jews produced and studied and learn to understand them as both expressions of Jewish identity and responses to specific historical circumstances. The course, furthermore, aims to challenge widespread stereotypes of Jewish history, such as its \"lachrymose conception\" (Salo W. Baron) as a mere series of suffering and persecution. By contrast, we will investigate when and how Jews were actors in their own right and actively engaged with other cultures, religions, and social groups.

In this course we trace the emergence of a number of different \"Zionisms\" that would lead to the creation of the modern state of Israel.

Scrumptiously decorated and preserved, five interrelated songbooks from central France, known as the \"Loire Valley Chansonniers\" contain the majority of love songs from this period. Working from digitized versions of the songbooks, online editions, and modern audio recordings, we will address the following questions: what do the songbooks tell us about the culture in which they were created? How do the graphic decorations that frame each song interact with its music and lyrics? Lastly, by contextualizing these digital sources with respect to the growing interest in the interface between the humanities and digital technology, we will discuss what we can gain from these developments and what-if anything-we stand to lose.

        "description": "In the later Middle Ages, there is a flowering throughout Christian Europe of religious writings that offer a new voice in which personal religious experience can be pursued and expressed. Their voices are mainly intended to be communal ones, to be contained within the Church and regulated by it. But in each case the fact that it is a voice may offer a mode of resistance, or of difference. Such writing is often aimed at lay people, sometimes exclusively at women; and sometimes the intended auditors become the authors, and propose a version of religious experience that claims a new and more intimate kind of power for its readers.  This course looks at a wide range of such writing in vernacular languages read in translation (English, French and German), including the work of Meister Eckhart, Marguerite Porete, Margery Kempe, Julian of Norwich, Eleanor Hull, the anonymous writer of The Cloud of Unknowing and the perhaps pseudonymous William Langland, author of Piers Plowman. Whether such writing seeks to be orthodox or conducive to heresy, it presents a challenge to the power of clergy - a challenge that is written in the vernacular language of lay people, rather than clerical Latin, and in doing so offers distinctively new voices for religious experience. The course will also look at ways in which such work might have been influenced, if only oppositionally or at times indirectly, by contact with Muslim and Jewish writing (including Jewish exegesis of the Psalms).",

At its core, it asks the question, what did it mean for the Jews of Central and Eastern Europe to emerge from small market towns and villages to confront modern ethnicities, nations, and empires? What lasting impact did the shtetl experience have on Jewish life in a rapidly changing environment? The focus is on the Jewish historical experience in the countries that make up Central and Eastern Europe (mainly the Bohemian lands, Hungary, Poland, and Russia) from the late eighteenth century to the fall of the Soviet Union. Among the topics that we will cover are: Jews and the nobility in Poland-Lithuania; the multi-cultural, imperial state; Hasidism and its opponents; absolutism and reform in imperial settings; the emergence of modern European nationalisms and their impact on Jewish identity; antisemitism and popular violence; nationalist and radical movements among Jews; war, revolution, and genocide; and the transition from Soviet dominion to democratic states.

Considered to be one of the most important texts in Chinese history, it triggered a wide range of discourses on the nature of the universe and good living while informing diverse practices such as calligraphy, landscape painting, poetry, drama, Daoist ritual, Zen Buddhism, sitting meditation, and politics. In this course, we engage in both the Daoist classic's multifaceted content and its diverse reception over the last two millennia. In the first half, we read the Zhuangzi as a primary source focusing on its short philosophical vignettes on the possibility and limits of knowledge and language, its humorous anecdotes that celebrate deformed and useless bodies, its youthful invectives against Confucians, as well as its powerful calls to live a creative and independent life as a recluse. In the second half, we will encounter concrete responses to the Zhuangzi in the form of commentaries, paintings, plays, performances, and comic books that exemplify the scripture's far-ranging cultural impact. This course provides both a focused and multifaceted avenue to the cultural history of East Asia and a personal experience of the life-changing appeal and topicality of the text.",

        "description": "For centuries, Indians, Chinese, Jews, Malays, Arabs, Portuguese, Africans, Americans, English and a fascinating medley of other peoples have been circulating freely in the Indian Ocean as merchants, pirates, explorers, missionaries and pilgrims. From the Horn of Africa to Indonesia, the Indian Ocean has long witnessed a frantic exchange that cut across ethnic and language affiliations. We begin by exploring the early history of the Indian Ocean up till the 18th century. We then trace the spread of Islam in the region which has been dubbed the 'Muslim Lake.' Next, we focus on the consequences of increased European presence in the Indian Ocean from the late 18th century onwards. What effects did European imperial expansion have on Indian Ocean trade, migration patterns and the religious haj pilgrimage? Vivid travel narratives provided by Joseph Conrad and Amitav Ghosh challenge historical periodization that neatly divides world history into pre-colonial and colonial eras. During the 19th century, both Europeans and Asians, traders, migrants and haj pilgrims alike, travelled extensively across the Indian Ocean as before, albeit at a faster rate and in much greater numbers. This period coincided with the intensification of Indian and Arab migration to Southeast Asia. How did the advent of colonialism accompanied by immense technological development in the 19th century actually affect the political and economic relations in the Indian Ocean? We round off the semester with sections of Robert Kaplan's seminal book on contemporary politics in the Indian Ocean. How relevant is Islam during the 21st century?",

We will start with a brief introduction into the history of Iberian Jews prior to 1492, asking how this experience created a distinct subethnic Jewish group: the Sephardim. We will then follow their migratory path to North Africa, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, the Netherlands, and the Americas. The questions we will explore include: in what sense did Jews of Iberian heritage form a transnational community? How did they use their religious, cultural, and linguistic ties to advance their commercial interests? How did they transmit and transform aspects of Spanish culture and create a vibrant Ladino literature? How did the Sephardim interact with Ashkenazi, Greek, North African, and other Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities? How did Jewish emigres from Spain and Portugal become intermediaries between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire? What was the role of Sephardim in Europe's transatlantic expansion? How did conversos (converts to Christianity) return to Judaism and continue to grapple with their ambiguous religious identity? How did Ottoman and North African Jews respond to European cultural trends and colonialism and create their own unique forms of modern culture? How did the Holocaust impact Sephardic Jewry? The course will end with a discussion of the Sephardic experience in America and Israel today.",

This course considers these questions through the investigation of significant attempts to study religion over the past century, paying particular attention to the methods, motivations, and aims of these works. Is the study of religion an effort to disprove or debunk it, or perhaps to support it? What would each mean? Is it an effort to describe the indescribable, or perhaps to translate complex beliefs and practices into a language in which they can be discussed by others? Why would such a translation be helpful, and to whom? Is the study of religion an investigation of a social phenomenon, an organization of communities, a specific formation of individuals, or perhaps a psychosis or illusion, evidence of the workings of power on our lives and the difficulty of bearing it? What is at stake in defining religion in these ways, and then in undertaking its study? In this course, we will discuss major theoretical approaches to the study of religion in relation to these questions and others, toward a better understanding of what religion might be and how it might be studied today.

        "description": "When the 13th century author Ibn al-Adim from the city of Aleppo, Syria, titled his book on food Reaching the Beloved through the Description of Delicious Foods and Perfumes, he was perhaps not concerned so much with simply how to satisfy hunger. Thinking through the title alone opens a window for us on all sorts of cultural, social, economic, and political questions about food and drink. Our history as humans with food is long and complicated. It extends from seeking basic nutrition to sustain our livelihood to contracting diseases. Food also plays a fundamental role in how humans organize themselves in societies, differentiate socially, culturally, and economically, establish values and norms for religious, cultural, and communal practices, and define identities of race, gender, and class. Food has been one of the most visible signs of social status in any given society and a vital part of many movements of political and social reform and transformation. Food has been a major question in trans-regional, international, and recently global cooperation and conflict as well. This course will cover the history of food and drink in the Middle East to help us understand our complex relation with food and look at our lives from perspectives we intuitively feel or by implication know, but rarely critically and explicitly reflect on. This course does not intend to spoil, so to speak, this undeniably one of the most pleasurable human needs and activities, but rather to make you aware of how food shapes who we are as individuals and societies. We will study the history of food and drink in the Middle East across the centuries until the present time, but be selective in choosing themes, geographic regions, and historical periods to focus on. Course work is geared toward increasing your ability to think about food and drink analytically as a socio-economic and cultural capital, noticeable marker of identity, and indicator of a political position. In a sense we will try to tease out in class why we are what we eat! Please consult the instructor if you have not taken any course in the humanities.",

We will examine a series of empirical cases, including recent events, and assess the relevance of models based on individual psychological dynamics, intuitive moral capacities, and human motivation for participation in collective action.",

It will begin in the fourth century after the conversion of Constantine the Great and end with the great witchcraft trials of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  The seminar will read magical treatises, ecclesiastical polemics against vulgar belief, inquisitorial trials, chronicles, and histories, in our attempt to define what was considered the ordinary and the extraordinary, the natural and the supernatural, good and evil, the boundaries of heaven and earth.  How do modern historians use medieval documents to evoke the lives of men, women, and children who believed in magic or were accused of heresy?  Can this only be done through a form of historical anthropology?  What methods do historians use in trying to understand past ideas and practices? What is historical truth then?  What is the relationship of supposedly heterodox belief and behavior with religious orthodoxy?  How do we define religion?  A theme throughout this seminar will be the definition of evil and the powers of the devil. Students will write a short historiographic essay and a long research essay. Pre-modern, Europe.

In this course we trace the emergence of a number of different \"Zionisms\" that would lead to the creation of the modern state of Israel.  And we explore how the political principles at the core of these ideologies have fared in the 65 years since the founding of the modern Jewish state.  \n\nThe course is at its heart applied political theory: a case study of the way that ideas emerge from historical events, take on a life of their own, and then shape real outcomes in the world.

We will discuss the subtleties of their political analyses, pinpointing the key differences and similarities of their philosophies, approaches, and legacies, and we will apply these debates of the mid-twentieth century to contemporary events and social movements in terms of how their legacies are articulated and what we can learn from them in struggles for justice and recognition in twenty-first century America and beyond.",

Is the study of religion an effort to disprove or debunk it, or perhaps to support it? What would each mean? Is it an effort to describe the indescribable, or perhaps to translate complex beliefs and practices into a language in which they can be discussed by others? Why would such a translation be helpful, and to whom? Is the study of religion an investigation of a social phenomenon, an organization of communities, a specific formation of individuals, or perhaps a psychosis or illusion, evidence of the workings of power on our lives and the difficulty of bearing it? What is at stake in defining religion in these ways, and then in undertaking its study? In this course, we will discuss major theoretical approaches to the study of religion in relation to these questions and others, toward a better understanding of what religion might be and how it might be studied today.

What lasting impact did the shtetl experience have on Jewish life in a rapidly changing environment? The focus is on the Jewish historical experience in the countries that make up Central and Eastern Europe (mainly the Bohemian lands, Hungary, Poland, and Russia) from the late eighteenth century to the fall of the Soviet Union. Among the topics that we will cover are: Jews and the nobility in Poland-Lithuania; the multi-cultural, imperial state; Hasidism and its opponents; absolutism and reform in imperial settings; the emergence of modern European nationalisms and their impact on Jewish identity; antisemitism and popular violence; nationalist and radical movements among Jews; war, revolution, and genocide; and the transition from Soviet dominion to democratic states.

In addition to this ancient focus, the course aims to relate many of the most historically durable characteristics of the region to contemporary developments of the past two or three centuries.  Fundamentally, this course asks us to reconceptualize the notion of \"civilization\" from the perspective of societies whose dominant forms of organization defied typical classifications such as \"states\" or \"empires\" and, instead, shaped a wholly different social order over the past 5000 years or more.  This class provides a well-rounded experience of the geography, social organization, and social interconnections of one of the most essential and pivotal regions in world history and contemporary political discourse.",

This course explores these questions with a sociological lens. We will use foundational sociological theories to learn how to recognize the existence of multiple realities, and consider the implications of social constructionism for key domains of everyday life, American politics, and the production of knowledge.

The American Dream is built around the idea that anyone, regardless of his or her origins, can have a fair start in life. Yet recent research shows that the promise of the American Dream is uneven across the nation. Poor children growing up in San Jose, CA are three times more likely to escape poverty than those in Charlotte, NC. What might be driving these geographic differences in opportunities for low-income youth? We will investigate factors that might drive these differences by working with interesting data. We will explore cutting-edge research on poverty and mobility in America to develop our own research questions. We will also develop the computational and statistical skills to put our ideas into practice by learning to manipulate data and make graphs that communicate our findings effectively.

Second, the course will engage with the ideological transformations in Mexican literature resulting from the so-called \"transition to democracy\" as well as the increase in political and criminal violence. Finally, the course will debate various concepts utilized to understand the aesthetics and politics of Mexican literature, including \"necroescritura,\" \"desapropiaci\u00f3n,\" \"narconarrativa\" and \"postliteratura.\" These study will be conducted by focusing on key authors who are at the center of literary practice today, such as Juan Villoro, Valeria Luiselli, Cristina Rivera Garza and Juli\u00e1n Herbert, as well as writers who are proposing fundamental changes of paradigm in literary writing: Yuri Herrera, Guadalupe Nettel, Sara Uribe and Jorge Humberto Ch\u00e1vez, among others.",

Primary focus will be given to the ways that Don Quijote deploys and questions the use in early modernity of the mediums of cultural production (various types of writing, orality, visual representation) to shape knowledge and collective memory; its representation of imperialism and colonialism; and its creation of linguistic and ideological pluralism, reflecting the realities of its world.

        "description": "We live in a visual culture, which is also a culture of appropriation.  In a single day, you might watch Superman v. Batman; play Arkham City on Playstation; watch the Badman parody by Pete Holmes; send a meme with Batman slapping Robin; take pictures of a Batfamily group cosplay at a comicon; read a Prezi Batman visual essay; or on Halloween give Batman candy to a Batkid.  These representations (or, images) of Batman illustrate appropriation at play in our multilayered visual culture-any of them could be reiterated, interrogated, or discussed further in the cultural production of the visual and most of them are not official or controlled by DC Comics, the owner of Batman.  Viewing and understanding these images of Batman-or any other iconic figure of American popular or political culture-requires visual literacy. We encounter and interact with the most immersive, compelling, and culturally relevant texts-whether stories, memes, concepts, characters, personalities-through visual means and visualizing is central to cultural production and consumption today; therefore, visual literacy is a necessary part of cultural education and understanding. This course takes a visual literacy approach-learning how to read different kinds of visual texts across a series of axes (static/moving, isolated/contextual, displayed/encountered, original/copied/transformed)-while placing those media within a larger context of cultural analysis as part of American Culture Studies and across a range of disciplines-cinema studies, literary analysis, art history and criticism -to learn how meaning is constructed visually. For some assignments students  will produce visual texts as part of demonstrating their understanding of visual culture and literacy.",

        "description": "From the great \"sores\" on the body politic described by Thomas Jefferson to the struggles over \"blight\" and gentrification of the modern era, the city has always served as a place that has intrigued, overwhelmed and at times repulsed Americans. This course is a history of the sensory landscape of the American city-how it looked, smelled, sounded, tasted and felt-and the deeper meanings Americans have invested within it. We will explore the laden social meaning of terms like \"filth,\" \"darkness\" and \"slum\"-as well as their antonyms in \"sunlight,\" \"health\" and \"home\"-and how they influenced the ways in which Americans not only perceived the city but sought to understand, master and, at times, reimagine it. Sensory perceptions of city life, we will find, were deeply connected to emerging ideas about race, class and gender. Moreover, the senses have always played a key role in working out larger questions of urbanism and urban form: What is the role of the city in American life? Is it a social problem or a place of opportunity and liberation? How have Americans responded to and sought to impose order on the ever-changing-and at times chaotic-urban landscape? \n\nStudents will be introduced to a wide array of primary sources through course readings, ranging from government documents to first-hand accounts of reformers to maps, images and literature. While touching a broad array of subjects, readings will center on discourses of health, disease, and sanitary reform, in large part because of their intimate connection with evolving sensory perceptions of the city. Assignments will consist of two primary source analyses and a final paper focusing on a research question of the student's choosing, which will be formulated in consultation with the instructor over the course of the semester.",

        "description": "It is said that at this time in history the entire country must make a commitment to improve the positive possibilities of education.  We must work to lift people who are underserved; we must expand the range of abilities for those who are caught in only one kind of training; and we must each learn to be creative thinkers contributing our abilities to many sectors of our society.   In this course, we expand our views about learning by experimenting with the creative process of lateral thinking.  In the first six weeks of the semester, we learn about learning by meeting with exceptional people with many scholarly, professional, and civic engagement accomplishments.  We also learn by working in teams to develop an exciting set of 2-D / 3-D, hands-on, problem-solving workshops for middle-schoolers from economically disadvantaged urban families; the workshop curriculum is be based upon your knowledge and passion as well as your interests. During the last eight weeks, we deliver these workshops once a week to students at Compton-Drew Middle School (adjacent to the Science Center in the city of St. Louis).  In this course we celebrate the choices of studies we each pursue, and expand our experience by learning from each other's knowledge bases and creativity.  The course is offered each Fall and Spring semester, and is open to students from all disciplines, schools, freshmen through seniors, and meets the Multidisciplinary Fieldwork requirement for AMCS majors.  **Attendance Mandatory for the first week of Classes.**  NOTE: On class days scheduled for the middle school, students must account for transportation time between WU and Compton-Drew so plan accordingly to ensure arrival by 1pm.\n\nTo meet compliance with University Policies on Minors, all students participating in this class will be required to undergo a fingerprinting background check, which is done on campus, prior to interacting with the Compton-Drew students. This carries a $50 Lab/materials fee to cover the cost of this check.",

It chooses a local narrative approach and situates the investigation in one of China's largest, complex, and most dynamic and globalized cities - Shanghai. The experience of the city and its people reveals the creative and controversial ways people redefined, reconfigured, and reshaped forces such as imperialism, nationalism, consumerism, authoritarianism, liberalism, communism, and capitalism. The course also seeks to go beyond the \"Shanghai model\" by comparing Shanghai with other Chinese cities. It presents a range of the urban experience in modern China.",

America's changing position as global consumer and dreamer is linked to increasingly violent contests over energy abroad while our fuel-dependent dreams of boundless (oil) power give way to uncertainties and new possibilities of nation, nature, and the future. Assuming that technology and markets alone will not save us, what might a culturally, politically, and socially-minded inquiry contribute to understanding the past and future of global energy and the American dream?",

Often marginalized in both the scholarship and popular memory, there exist a long unbroken chain of women who have organized around the principles of anti-sexism, anti-racism, and anti-capitalism. Frequently critical of heterosexist projects as well, these women have been the primary force driving the segment of the Black radical tradition that is commonly referred to as Black Feminism.  Remaining cognizant of the fact that Black Feminist thought has also flourished as an academic enterprise-complete with its own theoretical interventions (ie. standpoint theory, intersectionality, dissemblance, etc.) and competing scholarly agendas-this course will think through the project of Black Feminism as a social movement driven by activism and vigorous political action for social change. Focusing on grassroots efforts at organizing, movement building, consciousness raising, policy reform, and political mobilization, Feminist Fire will center Black Feminists who explicitly embraced a critical posture towards capitalism as an untenable social order. We will prioritize the life and thought of 20th century women like Claudia Jones, Queen Mother Audley Moore, Frances Beal, Barbara Smith, Audre Lorde, Angela Davis and organizations like the Combahee River Collective, Chicago's Black Women's Committee, and the Third World Women's Alliance. At its core, the course aims to bring the social movement history back into the discourse around Black Feminism.",

The contestation of citizenship in the U.S. and transnationally makes this question unavoidable for queer and feminist scholars. Provincializing European political history and Western liberal democracy, students will use queer theory to consider the costs of exclusion from, as well as inclusion in, citizenship. We will consider how 'queerness' as a concept and queer theory as a method of analysis can inform our understanding of nationalism, democratic formations, citizenship, transnational labor flows, colonialism and capitalism. Students will also get at questions of the cultural specificity of queer's anti-normative critique. Topics of discussion include the ways gender and sexuality constitute the role of the citizen; the relationship between citizenship and labor; how citizenship is \"performed\"; grassroots organizing through alternative citizenships; the politics of transgender recognition; homonationalism; and queer complicity in settler colonial state violence and the ascendency of global whiteness. We will also examine case studies of queer politics to compare different constructions of gender/sexuality/race across citizenship regimes. By the end of the course, students will be able to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of citizenship regimes on multiple continents and identify political alternatives to existing, state-centric solutions to violence and marginalization.

It's no secret that the violent abduction and sexual assault of women plays a constant-sometimes central, sometimes incidental-role in myth, history, fictional narrative, and poetry from the ancient Greeks to today. This class will consider the omnipresence of sexual violence in English literary history (and its antecedents) and ask why it is there, what its effects are, and how it shapes the way we think about gender, violence, freedom, and desire. This course contends that literature and literary history are keys to understanding the relationship between culture and sexual violence, and, conversely, that attention to sexual violence is key to understanding literary history. Students will acquire a broad historical understanding of consent as it evolved in literary, legal, and philosophical discourses to become a concept that organizes sexual and political freedom. We will ask: Is consent the best framework through which to mediate sexual harm? Are there alternative ways to imagine sexual encounters? How do various media manage sexual experiences? From the medieval romance to the eighteenth-century pornographic novel, from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" to \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" this course will interrogate how literary explorations of consent provoke theories of subjectivity, desire, and power.",

While women are the fastest growing population in prison, men still make up the vast majority of prisoners, and the system is largely geared toward men and their needs. In this course, we will explore the historical treatment of and contemporary issues for girls and women who get caught up in the criminal justice system.

Understandings of the proper roles, sensibilities, emotions, and dispositions of women and men are often culturally and morally loaded as indicators of the \"proper\" selves permitted in a given context.  Across cultures, then, gender often becomes an expressive idiom for the relative health of the self.  Gender identities or presentations that run counter to these conventions are frequently identified as disordered and in need of fixing.  In this course, we will take up these issues through three fundamental themes:  the social and cultural (re)production of gendered bodies and dispositions; the normalization of these productions and the subsequent location of \"madness\" in divergent or dissonant experiences of embodiment; and the situation of discourses of \"madness\" within debates of resistance and conformity, selfhood and agency.",

An inexhaustible public witness and the author of plays, essays, novels, and short stories, the Harlem-born Baldwin ranks with the most daring and eloquent American voices of the twentieth century. His first novel, the autobiographical \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" (1953), wrestled with the heritage of black Christianity and black social realism. His second novel, \"Giovanni's Room\" (1956), set in Paris and peopled with non-black characters, explored the complexity of same-sex desire years before the Stonewall riots announced the gay rights movement. \"Notes of a Native Son\" (1955), the first collection of Baldwin's lush and searching essays, is perhaps the most-tweeted book of our era and is listed among the Modern Library's top twenty nonfiction books of the twentieth century.  Our reading list will contain all of these books, but we'll also begin with Richard Wright's novel \"Native Son\" (1940), the young Baldwin's defining aesthetic enemy, and end with Ta-Nehisi Coates's memoir \"Between the World and Me\" (2015), the prize-winning Baldwin rewrite that illuminates the older author's elevated reputation in the wake of Black Lives Matter.

Building on a recent explosion of historical studies of American feminism, this course examines the history of the so-called \"second wave\" of the women's movement from its origins in the early 1960s to its alleged demise in the late 1980s.  Topics to be covered include the origins of feminist activism; the traditional history of the women's movement and recent revisions; how race and class shaped the feminist movement; how feminist ideas and organizing transformed American society; feminism and individual experience; and responses to the women's movement.  In this discussion-based course, we read scholarly analyses of the women's movement as well as memoirs, popular essays, and many primary documents from the period.",

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (or women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women. Over the years, this course has attracted WGSS students and pre-law students. This course is taught by law students under the supervision of a member of the School of Law faculty.

With this question in mind, we will explore the dynamic relationships between specific groups of refugees and nation-states, while considering inseparable intersectional configurations of gender, race, sexuality, ethnicity, class, age, and religion as lenses through which to consider ideas of personhood and notions of national belonging. In the first part of the semester we will focus on transnational displacement because of conflict and deterritorialization. We will utilize readings in feminist theory, post-colonial theory, and cultural studies to examine historical processes of dislocation and relocation.  The second part of the semester will examine ethnographic case studies of resettled refugees in different sites and their day-to-day practices to understand how displaced people earn a place in host societies. We will also explore how identity categories influence the architecture of personhood in nation-states. Lastly, we will analyze the multi-layered ways in which diasporic subjects and nations rearticulate themselves virtually and digitally (via Internet and social media).  We will combine diverse readings and theoretical engagements, lectures, documentary films, discussion, and class-based activities to interrogate notions of subjectivity, alterity, and belonging across time, place, and space.\nPre-Requisite:  L77 100B or consent of instructor.",

        "description": "The decades between the end of the Civil War and the 1930s saw the rise of a mass consumer culture that would dramatically reshape America. The fiction writers of this period, keen to capture the spirit of the age, helped to create the enduring idea that consumerism and an orientation toward material acquisition are at the heart of gendered concepts of American identity. Their stories documented, and sometimes celebrated, the emergence of recognizable \"types\" of American womanhood and manhood-such as self-made millionaires, ambitious \"working girls,\" bargain-hunting middle-class housewives, and the commercially minded women and men of the social and intellectual elite. At the same time, their stories articulated anxieties about U.S. consumer culture and its impact on the world. Students in this course will read, discuss, and write about novels and short stories by writers such as Henry James, Mary Wilkins Freeman, Kate Chopin, Theodore Dreiser, Edith Wharton, Nella Larsen, Langston Hughes, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Students in the course will also examine primary materials such as magazine advertisements, and will read and respond to relevant scholarship on the period.

In outlining the current stakes of precarity, this seminar will focus on two main threads of queer theory--queer of color critique and public feelings because both of these spaces have enabled complex theoretical and political discussions centered around precarity and both also introduce historical framings of queer theory. By orienting their contributions to queer studies around precarity, these scholars are asking both how one lives with this condition and what formations of knowledge have produced these conditions of liminality and vulnerability. Overall, this emphasis on precarity has made certain tensions surrounding the place of difference within queer theory visible and highlighted the role of structures, particularly neoliberalism, which is a particular nexus of collusion between the state and formations of capital, over the individual.",

We will also examine transnational feminist critiques of the public/private division in the Western political theory canon as it impacts the role of women and the social construction of women's bodies. During the second half of the semester, we will ask how various transnational social movements have engaged and adopted feminist theories in efforts to resist state violence, colonialism, labor exploitation and resource extraction. In following\nthese lines of inquiry we will draw from postcolonial, decolonial, liberal, Black, radical, Marxist and Chicana feminist perspectives.

It uses classical texts of the western tradition to investigate the question of justice and to develop arguable claims through the careful analysis of evidence. The act of crafting arguments, we will assume, is implicated in the question of justice because arguments depend on an ethics of persuasion. We will learn how to practice such an ethics as we improve our ability to understand and utilize four crucial aspects of academic writing: evidence, analysis, argument, and research. Mastering these aspects will make us proficient in the difficult art of judgment. It will allow us to make sense of some of the most powerful literary statements about justice, from \"Antigone\" to \"Crime and Punishment,\" from Shakespeare to Toni Morrison.

        "description": "Though it might seem mysterious why some kinds of writing are more effective than others, there is a technique for investigating how writing works at the level of the sentence. The Reed-Kellogg system of diagramming is a method of learning grammar and syntax by creating \"pictures\" of individual sentences. These diagrams show the logical relations between words, phrases, and clauses, and they illustrate the choices writers are making as they craft individual sentences. Using a recent book that extends and enlarges upon the Reed-Kellogg system, we will diagram sentences both famous and ordinary, both contemporary and of historical interest. Our aims will be (1) to learn the principles of the Reed-Kellogg system such that we are able to diagram any written or spoken \"sentence\" in English; (2) to use this knowledge to analyze how writers shape arguments at the sentence level, and how they achieve particular styles; and (3) to practice crafting and revising our own prose. Diagramming will help students understand how they can make their own writing more powerful, effective, and clear.",

But what is our role within this visual culture? Are we passive spectators or active participants? How does our personal, social, or cultural situation shape what and how we see and experience the world?  Throughout this course, students will explore these (and other) questions by drawing from a wide range of discourse communities and genres, including (but not limited to) art history, psychology, sociology, cultural studies, memoir, nonfiction, and creative writing.  Readings and assignments are designed to enhance students' awareness of the relationship between writing and their observations and experiences of the visual world.  Essay assignments will enable students to explore the visual world and their personal interest in related subjects (such as art, film, social media, and advertising). The course includes one personal essay, two expository essays, and one argumentative essay, as well as peer review workshops, oral presentation, and revision.  Additionally, students will prepare for essay assignments by generating ideas and experimenting with form and style through a series of in-class writing exercises.",

They skip generations or pop up in unexpected places, so we'll approach them both as movements or moments (Romanticism, Surrealism, the Nouveau Roman) and as concepts (parody, alienation, play).

Through poems, essays and film, we will study work which has cultivated large and small movements by poets such as Walt Whitman, Alexander Wat, Adonis, Anne Sexton, Paul Celan, and Ross Gay, as well as poems happening inside the collective, such as Dark Room and Black Took, and trends of fellowship from the Imagists to Kundiman. The focus of this course is collaborative and revolutionary poetry. The major question underlying this study is how strange and beautiful the poem can be with that aim.",

The course is also open to advanced writers from outside the concentration or major, but these students will be expected to petition the instructor for enrollment by submitting a work sample of 10 pages (in the instructor's mailbox by Dec. 1, 2017). This course will enable each student to situate their work in the context of a community of undergraduate writers, as well as in the larger literary world. There are several aspects to this seminar: as a group, you will read several books on writers and writing and discuss them over the course of the semester, finding ways to think and speak about your own writerly interests and creative practices. Next, through group workshops, you will respond to the work of your peers to whom you will submit your long form project in several stages. Visitors to our seminars will include fellows and faculty from the Washington University MFA program and visiting writers participating in the English Dept. reading series; you will have the chance to interact with these visitors in a series of Q&As in which we will learn about their individual creative practices. Finally, throughout the semester you will meet with your faculty guide to discuss the evolution of your project. After each meeting, students will be expected to prepare a response / assessment of the meeting, as well as a revision plan. Pre-reqs: Students must have completed the 200 and 300 level course sequence for the concentration.

In general, however, the internship is designed to give students a wide range of experience with literary publishing, and so will likely involve a mix of editorial tasks (e.g., reviewing submissions, writing reader's reports, copyediting manuscripts in layout), marketing, design, and book production and distribution. The intern will also have opportunities to represent the press publicly, including at the annual AWP conference (travel and hotel expenses will be covered), and his or her name will appear on the press's masthead. Interested students should submit a letter of application and CV to Professor Dutton (ddutton@wustl.edu) and Program Director David Schuman (dschuman@wustl.edu) no later than March 15 of the spring semester of their first year.

As students identify and select a social cause on which to focus, they will develop a series of print and digital works that communicate their chosen issue, pitch proposed design interventions, and visualize collaborative implementation processes. Learning modules will feature weekly readings, direct engagement with social design practitioners, design charrettes, and on-site learning, allowing students to gain greater depth and perspectives for harnessing design as a catalyst for change.

In order to take full advantage of the special experience of studying the renaissance in the very city of its birth, the stress is mainly, although not exclusively, on Florentine artists who include: sculptors such as Donatello, Verrocchio, and Michalengelo, painters such as Giotto, Masaccio, Uccello, Botticelli, Leonardo, and Raphael; architects such as Brunelleschi and Alberti up to Sangallo.

In many ways, St. Louis, Chicago, and New Orleans represent the major social and political forces that forged the modern American city. From westward expansion and the growth of the slave system, through mass European immigration and industrialization, the rise of Jim Crow and the decline of American industry, suburbanization, mass incarceration, and gentrification: all are visible in the landscapes of these American cities. Segregation of social groups, so often seen as natural or inevitable, is the result of historical processes, political decisions, public policies and individual actions. The course, in addition, will provide you with the opportunity to use some of the research techniques employed by urban scholars.

Computing has reshaped Architecture representation, questioning the edge between representation and reality through the form of images, integration of construction, material relationships, and the ability to manage complex information. The class equips students with the fundamentals of computing and constantly seeks to question how this technology would shape the built environment.  The course is divided into three distinct sections that examine various aspects of computing in architectural representation.  The first section instills the basic of Nurbs modeling in Rhinoceros software. Through the study of architectural\ndrawings, notations and inscriptions are studied and transcribed into a system of points, lines and surfaces. The system of relationships between points, lines and surfaces are manipulated through a series of transformative operations to create an accumulated field of volume.  \nThe second section explores the potential of image creation as a powerful simulation of spatial effects.  A series of atmospheric variations are introduced to produce differences in an occupant's spatial experience. Light, colors, textures, material deviation, camera angles are some of the strategies employed to generate sensations beyond the visual.  \nThe third section develops geometrical responses through variation of space to context relationship.  Parameters are first identified and assigned as forces to calibrate the system of relationships between points, lines and\nsurfaces that result in the inherent geometry.  Variations in these forces would create geometrical variations, making visible space to context relationships.

        "description": "During this five-day masterclass in Amsterdam & Rotterdam twenty students will have the opportunity to learn about behavioral studies and the design of public spaces. Working in small groups, students will acquire new perspectives and skills that put people and their needs at the heart of the creative process of re-imagining and transforming cities. Livability, lively cities, public life and other concepts describing inviting, vibrant and stimulating urban environments are frequently communicated in new visions for the future of cities today but are the most often unrealized component of design projects. This focus on 'urban life' is a direct reaction to the urban realities created in the 20th Century, where increases in our standards of living and the associated city building processes have created areas in which large and increasing numbers of people have become isolated from each other, socially and geographically. Despite our new awareness for the need to plan for a shared and intensified urban life in sustainable cities, we continue to have difficulties in understanding exactly what this 'urban life' is, how much of it we truly want and need, and how we can reconcile the often conflicting and simultaneous needs of people for privacy and social stimulation. Through field studies and observations the class will study behavior patterns in the major public spaces in Amsterdam and Rotterdam as a way to re-envision the importance of public space and its impact on the design of adjacent buildings and landscapes.\n\nOpen to all graduate students. Master of urban Design students receive priority. Visas are required to travel to the Netherlands depending on the passport country of the student. Preparation for visa applications begins on the first day of classes during the Spring semester. There is a minimum enrollment of eight by February 1st. The completion of both the Informal Cities (fall semester, 1 unit) and the Lively City (spring semester, 2 units) masterclasses may fulfill the Urban Issues elective requirement for MArch students.",

The final portion of the semester will allow the student to use energy simulation to update a design project from a previous studio course.  Each of these projects will be specific to the individual student and focused on the energy efficiency design principles which relate to the type of building, occupancy, climate, and design aesthetics of the original project.

        "description": "We are on the very cusp of a revolution that introduced a widespread integration of autonomous robotics in processes that are associated with design and construction. This shift, that despite its various connotations, is not here to render knowledge, skill and experience as obsolete, but to supplement a specific set of tedious and repetitive tasks that are often regarded as the very core of lost productivity or inability to truly capture built environment. \n\nToday's design and construction industry is plagued with inefficiencies starting with contractual agreements, interoperability challenges, completeness of documents, procurement practices, resource planning, inefficient use of equipment and energy on construction sites, and fluctuating costs of materials. The acknowledgment of these inefficiencies creates a suitable environment for the introduction of low cost technological solutions that if implemented correctly can alter the existing dynamic of project delivery. Since 2010, we have witnessed a proliferation of UAVs associated with the reduced cost of their accessibility while pioneering design, engineering and construction companies were investigating how to weave them into their existing processes. The not so apparent drawback of this line of reasoning is in its inability to tap into the full potential of robotics and AI, thus concealing the ability of new technology to impact the symbiotic relationship between design thinking and omnipresent sensory experience and analysis.\n\nThrough the exposure to information obtained via reality capture technology and its associated processes of laser scanning, photogrammetry and multispectral analysis, the students will be confronted with several speculative scenarios.\n\nEach of these scenarios will take into account virtual quality of captured environment and its temporal reference, while trying to understand how navigate through the concepts of Big Data and universal connectivity. Manipulation of virtual matter and examination of its properties could lead to the capture of movement through time and juxtaposition of its inherent quality with reimagined material presence of the new design. \n\nThe journey that starts with something as simple as defining the origin of a new synthetic environment and designers ability to operate required technology (laser scanners, drones and different sensors) will through the course of semester grow into purposeful manipulation of that information and definition of a new workflow as being determined by this new medium and a set of  design tools that are currently used in design process.",

Here, the design of skin systems allows for a tangible understanding of space. During the first part of the semester students will explore the design of a second, expanded skin that responds to specific conceptual or environmental criteria. That skin will then be developed into a small enclosure that maintains the conceptual strategies of the original design, bridging the flexible spaces around the body and the rigid space of the building. \n\nIn addition to the design project, the class will consist of lectures and readings exploring the work of artists, architects and writers such as Rebecca Horn, Lygia Clark, Michael Webb, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, among others. This class will engage constructive techniques from both the fashion and architectural disciplines. Rhino and associated plugins (grasshopper, t-splines) will be used for digital investigations of the body in space and the design of the layered constructions. Throughout the semester, students will utilize both digital fabrication tools including, but not limited to lasercutting, CNC milling and 3d printing, along with sartorial techniques such as darting, draping, patterning and pleating.

        "description": "Public space is a key constituent that determines the character of a neighborhood and a city. It is embedded the urban fabric and it can mediate the relationship between people and their particular surrounding landscape. Urban furniture and hardscape can play an important role in offering a wide range of uses for public spaces. The design of such pieces affects the way people live and experience a particular environment. The ultimate goal of this course is to design, fabricate and install a set of repeatable units to equip a vacant urban lot in order to offer opportunities for social interaction. The seminar focusses on the in-depth understanding and development of ideas based on the technical, experiential and aesthetic exploration of one material: concrete, into one specific application: urban furniture. This seminar builds up on the scope of the Creative Activity Research Grant awarded by the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts where 5 porous concrete pavers were designed for a vacant plot in North St. Louis. The challenges are: to adapt the given pavers to a new site condition and to propose new urban furniture made out of concrete. It involves the construction of pieces able to equip a gathering space as well as sidewalks that can offer local residents the opportunity to interact with others. This provides not only aesthetic appeal to the residents and visitors, but also allows the possibility of implementing an actual project in an abandon plot in Old North. We will enrich the community with a wide range of training opportunities as each step in the process of making the plaza will be used for teaching purposes, from making pavers and other pieces, to salvaging, reusing or repurposing recycled material.  Students are asked to design and build concrete urban furniture necessary for the gathering area. The pieces can encompass a wide range of uses: chair and benches, tables, raised beds, planters, litter bins, modular fencing and mobility-related pieces such as bike racks, bollards and car stoppers. This is an opportunity for hands-on experience. These pieces have to consider the limitations of the material in terms of strength, weight, size, etc.; learning about the material itself as well as the act of construction, assemblage and mass production, which will include methods and technology, ranging from tools to molds. The formwork for the concrete pieces will be built through a process of CNC milling and rubber molds or vacuum formed plastic. The challenges are to define environmentally sensitive strategies for problem solving, conceptual development and poetic expression at both levels of the design process, conceptual and real. Sustainable principles such as the use of recycled materials as an aggregate in the concrete mix will be an important consideration. Construction is the ultimate goal of this class. We will be working in collaboration with Anova, a local manufacturing company dedicated to the design and production of site furnishings. Anova will provide some materials and bring their expertise to the project.",

Current practice typically manages this schism by separating design from the use of BIM for documentation and construction.  The class will seek to develop methods of design within a BIM environment, not through the translation or reshaping of traditional techniques, but through the design of a methodology that seeks to capitalize on what BIM enables: direct, digital collaboration and the facile management of large data sets.\nThis is not an introductory class.  Basic knowledge in Revit (or an alternative BIM software) is required. Skill in other parametric and 3D modeling software as well as a basic knowledge of Grasshopper or other algorithmic processes is strongly preferred.

The theme of climate addresses macro- and micro-climates, and the roles they have in developing architectural form through 'passive' strategies. The theme of site expands the idea of the architectural project to examine landform, position, access and region. The theme of energy looks at architecture as both embodied energy and a consumer of energy, to understand how the architect helps to control and direct these flows at macro and micro levels. \n\nTwo goals for the class are to provide students with ways of thinking about and of working with issues of sustainability which can inform their design practice, and to equip them with the basic knowledge needed to continue within the technology sequence.

        "description": "New Disciplinary Dynamics :  Blurs and Exchanges.  Over the past decade, the various professions engaged in the construction of the built environment have been investigating (both in theory and practice) a specific and deliberate blurring, hybridization, and expansion of the traditional semantic and historical categories of landscape, architecture, and urbanism in an attempt to confront changing situations, environments, and cultures. Across geographical and cultural boundaries, the proliferation of projects (speculative and built) and essays appearing in recent years makes this phenomenon more than a passing trend or the product of individual reflection. \n\nArchitecture, for example, as a conventional discipline with its own tasks, internal logic, and modus operandi has become so heterogeneous that it can no longer adequately authenticate its products from within the limits of its historical category. The same holds true of the allied fields of landscape and urbanism. Strict disciplinary boundaries are no longer capable of attending to the complexity of contemporary demands produced by mobility, density, de-urbanization, hybrid programs, changing uses, and ecological concerns.  The contemporary world forcibly imposes the need for greater flexibility and indeterminacy and for new techniques of practice that are anticipatory, receptive to change, and capable of opening an aperture to the future. This course will explore these disciplinary slippages and hybrid contacts between until now distinct categories through essays and built or speculative works.   Fulfills Urban Issues and History/Theory elective.  Can count as a MUD Track elective.\nThe maximum enrollment for this course will be 12.",

Student teams will present analyses of a total of ten of Carlo Scarpa's built works, as well as analyzing the relation to Scarpa's works that can be found in the works of ten contemporary practices: Tod Williams + Billie Tsien, Steven Holl, Richard Murphy, Bridget Shim + Howard Sutcliffe, John Tuomey + Sheila O'Donnell, Shin Takamatsu, John and Patricia Patkau, Kathryn Dean/Dean-Wolf, Sverre Fehn and Tom Kundig/Olson-Kundig. Analytical methods employed in the student presentations in the course will cover the full range of contextual, cultural, material, constructive, and experiential attributes of buildings, with particular emphasis on the manner in which the spaces of a building are ordered by the patterns of occupation and the poetics of use, as well as the poetics of construction, or the way in which a building is built, and of what materials it is made, and how all these combine to construct the experience of those who inhabit it. Following introductory lectures by the professor, and introduction of the analytical methods and graphic standards, each of the subsequent ten class meetings will consist of two student-team presentations of architectural analyses, one building by Carlo Scarpa and selected buildings from a contemporary practice. Each team of two students will make two presentations, one in the first half of the semester, and one in the second half of the semester. Readings from the textbook and other sources will be assigned, to be discussed during each class. Individual research papers, as well as hardcopy and CD's of the two in-class presentations will be due at the end of the semester.

Building upon sources that refute this mythology, this seminar will examine the ways in which Venice used architecture and urban forms to impose social segregation as a means of combatting perceived threats and maintaining the desired equilibrium, producing typologies that remain influential today.  Examples from the period between 1400 and 1700 include the Jewish Ghetto, the public brothel for prostitutes, the casino for gamblers, hostels for foreign merchants, hospices for widows, and convents for upper-class women. We will trace the evolution of Venice's isolated geography-both natural and constructed, programs of urban development, and architectural expression in the context of the city's cultural history.

        "description": "This seminar will investigate the practices and measures by which sustainable urbanism is produced, substantiated, and evaluated, both projectively and retrospectively. Cities, where the majority of our resources are both spent and conserved, are sites of great contestation and negotiation where competing interests between status quo solutions and those that reinvent the urban paradigm are critical battlegrounds for a healthy, equitable and lasting future. In recent years, efforts have been made to quantify the \"success\" of individual buildings, neighborhoods and systems, but a holistic framework for deep evaluation evades those attempting to design, lead, and invest in cities. This course will consider: competing factors at play in the efforts towards sustainable urban production; existing evaluation metrics of sustainable cities and their dire shortcomings; emerging practices of cross-silo, cross-agency, and interdisciplinary urban work attempting to produce new, model paradigms; competing and complementary objectives and evaluations of sustainable, successful, and resilient cities, among other models. Consideration of firms, agencies, non-profits and quasi-public interest groups as well as scholarly, research-based efforts proposing evaluative and projective alternatives will be studied with a particular focus on contrasting contexts. The objective is not to develop a quantitative scoring system for cities, which results in superficial and reductionary grades, but to empower design and research students to understand the value added propositions of holistic urban thinking as a new paradigm for 21st century cities.\n\nThis course is required for the Doctor of Sustainable Urbanism students and is open to all MArch, MLA and MUD students.

Working in small groups, students will acquire new perspectives and skills that put people and their needs at the heart of the creative process of re-imagining and transforming cities. Livability, lively cities, public life and other concepts describing inviting, vibrant and stimulating urban environments are frequently communicated in new visions for the future of cities today but are the most often unrealized component of design projects. This focus on 'urban life' is a direct reaction to the urban realities created in the 20th Century, where increases in our standards of living and the associated city building processes have created areas in which large and increasing numbers of people have become isolated from each other, socially and geographically. Despite our new awareness for the need to plan for a shared and intensified urban life in sustainable cities, we continue to have difficulties in understanding exactly what this 'urban life' is, how much of it we truly want and need, and how we can reconcile the often conflicting and simultaneous needs of people for privacy and social stimulation. Through field studies and observations the class will study behavior patterns in the major public spaces in Amsterdam and Rotterdam as a way to re-envision the importance of public space and its impact on the design of adjacent buildings and landscapes.\n\nOpen to all graduate students. Master of urban Design students receive priority. Visas are required to travel to the Netherlands depending on the passport country of the student. Preparation for visa applications begins on the first day of classes during the Spring semester. There is a minimum enrollment of eight by February 1st.

Over the past decade, the various professions engaged in the construction of the built environment have been investigating (both in theory and practice) a specific and deliberate blurring, hybridization, and expansion of the traditional semantic and historical categories of landscape, architecture, and urbanism in an attempt to confront changing situations, environments, and cultures. Across geographical and cultural boundaries, the proliferation of projects (speculative and built) and essays appearing in recent years makes this phenomenon more than a passing trend or the product of individual reflection. \n\nArchitecture, for example, as a conventional discipline with its own tasks, internal logic, and modus operandi has become so heterogeneous that it can no longer adequately authenticate its products from within the limits of its historical category. The same holds true of the allied fields of landscape and urbanism. Strict disciplinary boundaries are no longer capable of attending to the complexity of contemporary demands produced by mobility, density, de-urbanization, hybrid programs, changing uses, and ecological concerns.  The contemporary world forcibly imposes the need for greater flexibility and indeterminacy and for new techniques of practice that are anticipatory, receptive to change, and capable of opening an aperture to the future. This course will explore these disciplinary slippages and hybrid contacts between until now distinct categories through essays and built or speculative works.   Fulfills Urban Issues and History/Theory elective.  Can count as a MUD Track elective.\nThe maximum enrollment for this course will be 12.",

Designers denigrated unruliness in the pursuit of modernization in the 20th century, but today seem more conflicted on the constitution and remedies for disorder. Is disorder in the eye of the beholder? What disrupts urban life more, the broken windows of vacant houses or the arrival of Whole Foods in a poor neighborhood? Neighborhoods that have lost most of their population and buildings, or new football stadiums offered as economic and architectural solutions to blight? Programs of \"right-sizing\", urban agriculture, tactical urbanism, infrastructure planning, police reform, upzoning (or unzoning), historic preservation and mass transportation have operative impacts that can either squelch and protect the \"unruly.\" This course examines the divergent definitions of order and disorder that are shaping contemporary approaches to urban planning, governance and cultural production.
