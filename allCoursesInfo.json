One is to teach students -- via lectures, reading assignments, homework and exams, to think on their own, to solve problems, and how engineering principles are applied to the areas of bioelectricity, biomechanics, biomolecules, biotechnology, and bioimaging.  The second is to introduce students, via guest lectures by school of medicine and engineering faculty, to some of the fascinating and challenging ongoing research in these areas.  By the end of the course students will have begun to acquire the skills and approaches necessary to succeed in the engineering curriculum as well as a much more in-depth and informed perspective of BME.   Corequisites:  Phys. 117A or 197, Chem 111A, and college level calculus.",

        "description": "This is an applied course in capital budgeting under uncertainty and flexibility.  Traditional NPV analysis assumes that corporate investments are \"now or never\" and that they are irreversible.  However, most corporate projects have a great deal of flexibility in their timing, scale, etc.  Our goal is to develop more advanced capital budgeting skills so that the student may attack real-world corporate investment decisions in a sophisticated way.  There are five learning objectives: \n1.  Identification of optionality in corporate investments.  Before we can\napply option pricing theory to corporate decisions, we must be able to correctly characterize the optionality inherent in the projects we are considering.  \n2.  Choosing the proper model for the analysis.  The decision-maker's goal is to get the best possible approximation of the value of an opportunity given the constraints of time, cost, and information.  Structured and carefully-defined problems allow for more precision. \n3.  Handling risk in the proper way through risk-neutral pricing.  As we will demonstrate, the use of a risk-adjusted discount rate is not appropriate when valuing assets with \"optonality.\"  We must proceed by risk-neutral valuation.  \n4.  Understanding and handling the convenience yield issue.  This is perhaps the most difficult issue to grasp, but it is vitally important to a sophisticated analysis.  We must adjust our problem for the \"convenience yield\" or \"rate of return shortfall\" of an asset whenever there is an \"early exercise\" feature.  \n5.  Clear presentation of analysis and results.  The ability to construct a sophisticated capital-budgeting model is irrelevant if its structure and results cannot be communicated in a clear and convincing fashion.  This is particularly important for real-option valuation, as most managers do not understand the issues of risk-neutralization and convenience yield.  Furthermore, there are many that are skeptical of the assumptions required for a contingent-claims analysis.  Their critiques must be addressed.\nMBA Prerequisites:  FIN 5203 and 532.

Most case discussions will be followed by a relevant guest speaker -either an experienced entrepreneur or a professional from the investment community. You will hear from entrepreneurs and corporate managers with an entrepreneurial flair, some who have experienced great success, and others for whom success has been elusive.\n\nThe structure of this course follows the evolutionary process of a new venture.  Topics covered include: Idea Assessment, Organization Formation, Capitalization, Growth, and Exit.  Corporate Entrepreneurship also will be explored.  This course integrates much of what you have learned in your core courses and challenges you to apply those learnings.  In each class you will be expected to make difficult business choices with less than perfect information, dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty, much like a real life entrepreneur.  Analytical rigor will be emphasized throughout and you will be expected to have \"run the numbers\" for each case.  \n \nA central element of this course is the opportunity to pitch your \"business idea\" to classmates via a 5 minute \"elevator pitch\".  Those with the winning business concepts will recruit classmates to join their team to conduct a comprehensive feasibility analysis. Your \"final\" will consist of a formal 20 minute dress presentation of your idea-much like you would pitch your business concept to a potential investor.  \n\nIt is the professors' objective that by the end of this course you will:\n1) Better understand entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial process\n2) Be an incisive analyst of a business and/or business concept\n3) Be a more persuasive seller of your business ideas.   \n\nNote:  This course is recommended for students interested in participating in the MGT 524.

We will examine best practices for different forms of value creation and analyze organizational situations from the perspective of a value-creation consultant.

In this case it is a question of what the photograph wants you to see and believe about East Asia. Your final project will involve either a creative or academic engagement of these issues in a photography of your choice.

What does it mean for race to be used a trend in American fashion? How did African Americans use clothing and grooming to proclaim in their communities and in the mainstream that they were beautiful? How was clothing used during American slavery to denote racial and class lines? How did African Americans use clothing in freedom struggles from the Civil Rights Movement to Black Lives Matter as a mode of communication? What role did hip hop play in shaping both the American fashion industry and mainstream perceptions of black life? How have mainstream fashion publications, clothing brands and more perpetuated and appropriated stereotypes of black life? How did black fashion publications introduce new images of black femininity into the mainstream?

        "description": "Nearly fifty percent of Africa's population now lives in urban areas. By 2050 this number is expected to triple to 1.23 billion or what will then be sixty percent of the continent's total population. This urban growth is happening alongside rapid economic expansion, technological innovations, and-in some cities-political insurrection. Many of these developments are taking place in peripheral urban areas that lack formal planning, basic infrastructure, and security.  Yet, as many theorists point out, the very lack of cohesive planning and stable infrastructure in urban Africa has produced flexible spaces where novel forms of dwelling, work, and leisure are possible. Many residents, often by necessity, rearrange their built environments to make the city function beyond the limits of its original design. In the process, urban dwellers produce new built spaces, aesthetics, and economic practices, calling into question assumptions about what a city is and how it works. What are the implications of Africa's urban revolution for both the people who inhabit these cities and the world at large? How will Africa's urban future shape what some theorists are calling \"the African century?\" What can contemporary cities across the continent tell us about the future of urban life everywhere? In this seminar, we will explore these questions by surveying a variety of case studies and topics from across the African continent. The purpose in focusing on Africa in general is not to homogenize an incredibly diverse continent, but to make connections across a variety of different contexts in order to explore conceptual debates and assemble a theoretical tool-kit that is useful for grappling with themes that are simultaneously abstract and concrete.",

Echoing these general themes, this course closely examines the causes, development, and\nconsequences of urban inequality in the U.S. context. In order to explore U.S. urban inequality most clearly, the course focuses on the African-American urban experience and what has variously been called the \"black belt,\" the inner city, and, most importantly, the ghetto. The scope is still national, though, with analyses of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, D.C., Detroit, Chicago, New Orleans, Oakland, and St. Louis, among other cities. The course primarily draws from sociology and history but also includes insights from anthropology, political science, criminology, and law, among other disciplines.",

We observe black aesthetics in practices such as poetry, performance art, theater, dance, music, photography, film, and visual art. We study foundational and contemporary critical theory invested in black politics, black feminism, black resilience, black excellence, and black joy. We also engage with St. Louis artists, and practice producing artistic work, including a performance or action, a song or poem, and visual artwork or short film. No artistic experience is required.

Widespread optimism that these \"transfers of power\" would bring a new era of prosperity and dignity dissipated quickly as the new nations struggled with political instability, military coups, social unrest, and persistent poverty. Consequently many western observers and development specialists are certain that they have become \"failed states\" requiring foreign assistance to develop properly.  This course challenges these assumptions by tracing the origins of African governance and economic development from their imperial origins into the independence era.  By exploring nation-building, economic planning, and public administration from the perspective of political elites, foreign experts, and ordinary people the class takes an intimate look at how colonies became nation states. These new perspectives offer students a historical grounding in international public administration and development by exploring how imperial ideas and concepts continue to influence contemporary social planning and development policy in both Africa and the wider world.

The major purpose of the course is to gradually reveal how a city operates internally, and how it operates externally with its sister cities, surrounding metropolitan areas and neighboring states, amidst competing and often contradictory interests.  Utilizing historical analysis as a guide, the course will briefly revisit the experiences of previous waves of ethnic groups to the St. Louis metropolitan area, as a lens for understanding the current social, political and economic dilemmas which many urban dwellers in St. Louis now face. The course will reveal to students the intricacies of social welfare issues and policies among high density populations, in St. Louis, that are homogeneous and heterogeneous, at the same time.  Visits and discussions with various governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and how such agencies function or dysfunction for various constituencies allow students to ask crucial questions regarding equality of opportunity in a democratic society.  Students will also encounter diverse communities and neighborhoods and the intended and unintended consequences of social welfare policies designed to ameliorate urban dilemmas such as poverty and inequality, homelessness, educational underachievement, gentrification, migration and immigration, development, health care, fiscal issues, the informal economy, and issues concerned with crime and social justice, among others.  Readings are reinforced and challenged through visits, interactions and observations with broad constituencies and institutions, ranging from city officials to community residents.  As such, this course offers a survey discussion of the rich interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies for those who may be interested in pursuing a stand alone major in the field of Urban Studies.",

This is an urgent question at a historical moment when American society is becoming more diverse and more unequal. Through a sociological lens, this course explores key areas of inequality: social class and poverty, racism and sexism, the crisis in health care, and the perils of globalization. We examine empirical underpinnings of these areas focusing on the intersection of statuses related to race, social class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality that heighten risk for social and political disadvantages. Our investigation capitalizes on rich sources of multidisciplinary data and methods. These sources offer a foundation for an original research project allowing students to gain an understanding of the complexity of social problems emanating from inequality, and productive intellectual and policy responses. Guests from agencies dealing directly with these issues will share perspectives. Students will emerge from the course with critical skills that empower them to decipher contemporary policy debates and develop their own critical analyses.",

First, we examine the Puritan sermon that politicians quote when they describe America as a \"city on a hill.\"  This sermon has been called the \"ur-text\" of American literature, the foundational document of American culture.  Learning and drawing from multiple literary methodologies, we will re-investigate what that sermon means and how it came to tell a story about the Puritan origins of American culture -- a thesis our class will reassess with the help of modern critics.  In the second part of this class, we broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years.  Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day.  Our last days will be spent discussing the rhetoric and legacy of American exceptionalism in the speeches of Obama and Trump.

Between these two landmark characters lie the two and a half centuries of rich and diverse fiction for girls that will be at the center of this writing-intensive course. After grounding our studies by reading selected works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we will concentrate on twentieth-century productions, beginning with the surprisingly progressive serial fiction produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate and others in the early 1900s. (Titles such as The Motor Girls, The Moving Picture Girls, and The Outdoor Girls advertise the series\u00b4 departure from domestic settings.) Throughout our study of both popular and classic texts, we will investigate the social, political and familial roles for girls that the texts imagine. Major genres will include mysteries, frontier fiction, career fiction, domestic fiction, school stories, and fantasy. Authors will include Newbery, Alcott, Montgomery, Wilder, Lindgren, and \"Carolyn Keene.\"  Writing Intensive. Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

        "description": "Starting with Allan Bloom's \"The Closing of the American Mind,\" a book that helped re-ignite the Culture Wars, this course will consider the debates and problems that pervaded American culture during the 1990s. From the end of the Cold War to the sexual scandals that rocked Bill Clinton's presidency, from the emergence of the Internet to the rise of grunge and rap, the 1990s were a time of vast change in American culture. It was period when we, as a nation, reconsidered the legacy of the 1960s, the Reagan revolution, and the end of the Cold War, a time of economic expansion and cultural tension. In our consideration of this period, we will take a multidisciplinary approach when tackling a variety of materials-ranging from literary fiction (Philip Roth's \"The Human Stain,\" Jonathan Franzen's \"The Corrections\") and popular films (Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" and The Cohen brothers' \"The Big Lebowski\") to personal memoir and the music of Nirvana and Public Enemy-in an attempt to come to a better understanding of our recent history. Throughout the semester, we will pursue the vexed cultural, political, and historical questions that Americans faced in the years between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, and consider how literary texts imagined this period of American history. Other possible texts include David Foster Wallace's \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,\" Joan Didion's \"Political Fictions,\" Toni Morrison's \"Paradise,\" John Updike's \"Rabbit at Rest,\" and Elizabeth Wurtzel's \"Prozac Nation.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

However, it is not only lawyers who need to be able to incorporate the law into their professional practice: in this course, we will look at the many different types of writing in and about the law to see how the principles of rhetoric must be used to persuade in different ways depending on the writer's purpose. We will learn the skills necessary to adapt the framing of our writing to its audience as we think about how we might persuade a judge, a lay client, a community, a committee or other professionals. We will consider the psychological effects of our writing and how we seek to persuade our readers not only with the strength of our reasoning but with the power of our emotional appeal to their particular interests. We will learn how to think and write about the law in a range of circumstances as assignments cover writing for business about implications of laws, reporting about a law for the popular press, investigating a legal issue and explaining a law's ramifications as well as attempting to encourage support for a particular law; this is not, however, a technical legal writing course. Readings will be drawn from statutes and judgments but more commonly from academic, business and popular examples of writing on the interpretation of laws governing topical concerns. Issues to be dealt with may include the extent of police/citizens' rights to protect themselves (so-called Stand Your Ground laws); rights to refuse medical treatment (Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dept of Health); religious groups' rights to discriminate (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act); Open Carry laws (St. Louis Zoo v Smith); immigration proposals such as The Dream Act; reform of mandatory prison sentences.",

Echoing these general themes, this course closely examines the causes, development, and\nconsequences of urban inequality in the U.S. context. In order to explore U.S. urban inequality most clearly, the course focuses on the African-American urban experience and what has variously been called the \"black belt,\" the inner city, and, most importantly, the ghetto. The scope is still national, though, with analyses of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, D.C., Detroit, Chicago, New Orleans, Oakland, and St. Louis, among other cities.

Why did ragtime come to symbolize interracial and international mixture in the early 20th-century American novel, and how did jazz--and the slogan of the \"Jazz Age\"--grow to signify the national distinctiveness of American modernism? How did rock help to steer the postmodern turn, and why is rap now canonizing itself as an academic poetry through thick anthologies and footnote-heavy artist memoirs? How has American writing's long-running commentary on popular music affected that music's history and mythology--and vice versa? Writers (and writer-musicians) to be studied include James Weldon Johnson, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Langston Hughes, Louis Armstrong, Gwendolyn Bennett, Jack Kerouac, Ralph Ellison, Frank O'Hara, Rita Dove, Bob Dylan, Don DeLillo, Patti Smith, Richard Hell, and Jay-Z.

When the state or a community wants its citizens or members to be \"good,\" it crafts laws and creates customs to encourage or inhibit behaviors.  This class examines how state and non-state actors have attempted to regulate the lived experiences of Americans and the conflicts that emerge over what, exactly, is correct, or right, or good for individuals, society, and the state.  It interrogates what values the state impresses upon its citizens and what values citizens want the state to uphold.",

During the semester, we will also screen several films, such as the award-winning Capote and the experimental documentary Looking for Langston. Throughout, we will consider a number of questions. What, if anything, is unique about queerness in America? How do American writers represent nonnormative sexualities, in either explicit or coded ways? In what ways did the pre-Stonewall U.S. enable lesbian and gay sexualities, and in what ways did it render those identities unsustainable? How do racial, class, and gender identities intersect with sexual identities? What is queer about the literary forms and styles these writers deployed?

This course considers these questions by examining contemporary art practices that champion black humanity, and intervene in anti-black racism in the criminal justice system, housing, education, employment, and everyday life. We observe black aesthetics in practices such as poetry, performance art, theater, dance, music, photography, film, and visual art. We study foundational and contemporary critical theory invested in black politics, black feminism, black resilience, black excellence, and black joy. We also engage with St. Louis artists, and practice producing artistic work, including a performance or action, a song or poem, and visual artwork or short film. No artistic experience is required. Texts of study include: Force Continuum by Kia Corthron; An Octoroon and Appropriate by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, A Seat at the Table by Solange; as well as visual art, poetry, and film by St. Louis-based artists.",

The Broadway musical, as a major American popular and artistic genre, has a long history of engaging with political discourse and policy - one that includes reinforcing, challenging, and shaping the cultural norms of the nation. This course examines the cultural and political history of the Broadway musical, using methodologies from a variety of disciplines, including performance studies, musicology, history, and political science. Focusing on issues such as gender, sexuality, race, imperialism, and nationalism, this course explores the complex relationship between popular culture and political thought. This is not a survey of the Broadway musical, but no prior knowledge of the musical or music more generally is required.",

        "description": "Emerging in American films most forcefully during the 1940s, film noir is a cycle of films associated with a distinctive visual style and a cynical worldview. In this course, we will explore the sexual politics of film noir as a distinctive vision of American sexual relations every bit as identifiable as the form's stylized lighting and circuitous storytelling.  We will explore how and why sexual paranoia and perversion seem to animate this genre and why these movies continue to influence \"neo-noir\" filmmaking into the 21st century, even as film noir's representation of gender and sexuality is inseparable from its literary antecedents, most notably, the so-called \"hard-boiled\" school of writing.  We will read examples from this literature by Dashiell Hammett, James Cain, Raymond Chandler and Cornell Woolrich, and discuss these novels and short stories in the context of other artistic and cultural influences on gendered power relations and film noir.  We will also explore the relationship of these films to censorship and to changing post-World War II cultural values.  Films to be screened in complete prints or in excerpts will likely include many of the following: The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Murder My Sweet, Phantom Lady, Strangers on a Train, The Big Sleep, The Killers, Mildred Pierce, The High Wall, Sudden Fear, The Big Combo, Laura, The Glass Key, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, The Crimson Kimono, Touch of Evil, Alphaville, Chinatown, Taxi Driver, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Bad Lieutenant, and Memento.

We try to answer the questions: What is conservatism and who are its adherents?  Can we speak of conservatism in the singular or are there several types of conservatism?  Are the various forms of conservatism politically and intellectually compatible?  How has conservatism changed since Reagan and the 1980s?

        "description": "Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes and analytical constructs for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, the enforceability of presidential travel bans; contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police.

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (or women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

This socialization comes in many forms, including the generation of sacred natural places (e.g., Mt. Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts.  Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as \"landscapes\".  This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times.  We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together.  Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents.  This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.

Social participation can be a challenge for people with disabilities, while resources to address these needs tend to be limited.  This course will begin by critically analyzing concepts of disability, Quality of Life, health and social participation. We will construct a framework for examining social participation and community resources across the lifespan.  Public health, educational and environmental theories and methods will be applied to programs and services that aim to enhance quality of life with disabilities. We will analyze ecological approaches to enhancing social participation. Upon completion of this course, students will be equipped to analyze challenges and prioritize resources for individual and population health.",

        "description": "In recent months we have learned that the Trump administration plans to re-negotiate NAFTA, extend the wall along the Mexico border, and pass large infrastructure bills.  Such protectionist policies are informed by an old idea: that investing in U.S.-made goods is not only stimulating to the economy, but inherently patriotic--that it will \"Make America Great Again.\" This seminar will explore the long-standing relationship between material consumption, political activism and identity.  How does 'buying American' (or 'local,' or from community-minded businesses such as TOM'S) express a sense of who we are as individuals, as identity-based communities, and as a nation?  How has it changed with the advent of social media and the digital marketplace?  What will be the fate of the old national-consumerist logic in this, a period of continued economic uncertainty and broad skepticism about the practices of multi-national corporations (not to mention the federal government)?  In considering these questions, we will look at historical cases ('See America First!' campaigns of the early 20th century, WWII war bonds, 'White label' activism, civil rights boycotts) as well as more-recent 'buy American' movements, including post-9/11 boosterism and various forms of 'conscientious capitalism.'  The priorities for our work will include: 1) developing a fuller historical imagination for claims about the political and social meanings of American consumption, broadly defined; 2) conceptualizing the relationships between specific consumer practices and objects (including the material goods themselves) and broad conceptions of shared identity and meaning; and 3) exploring different theories, methods, and approaches to cultural interpretation that might inform later research.  The final assignment will be a proposal for a future multidisciplinary cultural-studies project of students' own imagining that is informed by the work of the course.  As a Writing Intensive course, 375A also serves as an occasion to think about matters of argument and written presentation of ideas.\n \nPREFERENCE GIVEN TO AMCS MAJORS AND MINORS.",

        "description": "In 1989, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., cancelled its pending exhibit, Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment. Opponents of the exhibit rejoiced, arguing tax payers should not have to support the \"obscene\" photography. Advocates defended it, and its NEA funding, as freedom of expression. And unlike opponents they believed the work met the highest artistic standards. Advocates and opponents both claimed their positions represented democracy at work: proponents cited protection of first amendment rights and opponents named majority rule.  The Mapplethorpe controversy raises fundamental questions that frame this course: Is democracy good for the arts? Are the arts good for democracy? The partnership between the arts and government is vexed yet strangely collaborative. It promotes creative expression and civic participation despite of - and sometimes, because of - troublesome issues that state support for the arts, or, cultural policy, can generate. This course examines these issues, bringing into view the synergistic partnership between art and state and its significance for a democratic, creative society. We explore case studies from the 20th century that foreground this collaboration, among them WWI propaganda posters, New Deal art programs, NEA projects, and museum exhibits. These cases highlight the challenges of cultural policy and bring to light turning points in the relationship between government and the arts. They raise questions that prompt students to think critically about the connection between art and democracy and does so by considering the perspectives of artists and government officials. This historically grounded course draws on various fields of study to examine the context which state-sponsored art was produced, consumed, and interpreted. Students engage with visual and material culture, media, and archival materials. The seminar culminates in a final research project of the student's design; topics may be drawn from the early twentieth century to the present-day.

Of central importance are the Art Exhibits from Germany and Austria with their cultural-political implications. The German Emperor had a hand in selecting the German paintings to be sent to St. Louis, and his opposition against modern movements like Impressionism caused opposition in Germany. Austria was different: In their Art Nouveau Pavilion they included secessionists (Hagenbund). The Wiener Werkstaetten (Vienna's Workshops) attracted a lot of attention. Different from the paintings, German Arts and Crafts represented avant-garde movements. We will visit libraries, archives, and museums in St. Louis that have World's Fair holdings.

Moving from about 1830 to 1925, we will explore the development of a deeply contested discourse of \"national manhood\" in the United States, as it emerges in historically specific circumstances. How does whiteness intersect with related discourses of gender, sexuality, and social class? Beginning with the apocalyptic poetry and prose of Edgar Allan Poe, we will examine terrorized whiteness as an identifying feature of normative masculinity in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Henry James, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Do these authors claim the power to resist threats to their individual autonomy? To what extent do they experience masculine self-reliance as a myth? How do they imagine meaningful communities? Addressing these social issues and related aesthetic questions, we will venture, as Whitman says, \"in paths untrodden.\" Students will write three papers of increasing complexity and there will be shorter writing assignments as well.

First, the course emphasizes theories of public policy that frame the field of policy studies. Major questions extending from this course feature include: What is public policy, policy behavior, its defining processes/features and what social function does it serve? Second, the course emphasizes the skills related to the exercise of policy analysis. These skills include the crafting of technical documents within the field of public policy (e.g. a policy brief) and the application of scientific methods to the exploration of social problems/governmental actions. Likely issues related to this course feature include the use of scientific knowledge in political arenas, engagement with stakeholders and the intended/unintended consequences of policy science to political decision-making. Third, this course simulates the policymaking context through students' participation in mock congressional testimonies. These focal areas will become central to an understanding of four social concerns: school desegregation following the Brown decisions; affirmative action in higher education; Head Start programs and/or the ESEA Act of 1965, also known as No Child Left Behind. Educational opportunity, achievement inequality and social change will be the primary interests that link these course features.",

We investigate the globalization of the apparel industry, from production and circulation to marketing and branding, in order to understand the relationship between citizenship and consumption, labor and power in the global economy.  The course encourages students to reflect on their relationship to the wider society and economy as producers and consumers of material culture through the lens of clothing and fashion.",

This socialization comes in many forms, including the generation of sacred natural places (e.g., Mt. Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts.  Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as \"landscapes\".  This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times.  We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together.  Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents.  This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.  Join in situating your own social map alongside the most famous and the most obscure landscapes of the world and trace the global currents of your social landscape!",

These resources are inextricably linked not only to the most common and necessary of our day-to-day activities, but impact each other in profound ways.  Until recently, the study of these resources was fragmented in separate sectors, ultimately leading to lack of institutional coordination, infrastructural lock-in and incomplete modeling systems.  These incomplete systems overlook the complex overlaps of natural systems and render sustainability planning more tenuous than it could be.  In response, these core resources are being studied together as a \"nexus\" to enhance synergies and prevent trade-offs across sectors.  However, this nexus further requires astute attention to the all too \"human\" questions of resource use, waste and justice.  If water, energy and food security are to be simultaneously achieved, social scientists must be at the forefront, contributing holistic research that brings the human back into socio-natural systems.",

        "description": "The study of human remains in archaeological contexts offers us a rich perspective on human life and society in the past. Our bodies are shaped by genetics, environmental factors, subsistence, disease, and physical activities over the life course. At the same time, social organization, inequality, and ideologies also shape the human experience; they often become reflected in the built environments of tombs and cemeteries, the grave offerings, and interment styles that surround human remains in archaeological contexts. This course offers an introduction to bioarchaeology and mortuary archaeology as complementary approaches to the study of life in the past. The goal of the course is to understand how activities, norms and beliefs, and environments shaped bodies in life and death, and the different ways in which archaeologists can gain insight into the past through the study of human remains and burials. Course lectures and discussions focus on recent advances in research and ongoing debates in the two fields with examples from prehistory and history around the world, from North and South America, to Europe, Asia and Africa. Although this course will provide a basic overview of human skeletal anatomy, it is strongly recommended that students have taken an introductory course on the subject prior to enrolling in the class.",

        "description": "From the beginning of the human campaign, societies have socialized the spaces and places where they live.  This socialization comes in many forms, including the generation of sacred natural places (e.g., Mt. Fuji) to the construction of planned urban settings where culture is writ large in overt and subtle contexts.  Over the past two decades or so, anthropologists, archaeologists, and geographers have developed a wide body of research concerning these socially constructed and perceived settings -- commonly known as \"landscapes\".  This course takes a tour through time and across the globe to trace the formation of diverse social landscapes, starting in prehistoric times and ending in modern times.  We will cover various urban landscapes, rural landscapes, nomadic landscapes (and others) and the intersection of the natural environment, the built environments, and the symbolism that weaves them together.  Chronologically, we will range from 3000 BCE to 2009 CE and we will cover all the continents.  This course will also trace the intellectual history of the study of landscape as a social phenomenon, and will investigate the current methods used to recover and describe social landscapes around the world and through time.  Join in situating your own social map alongside the most famous and the most obscure landscapes of the world and trace the global currents of your social landscape!",

        "description": "This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore in some depth various facets of the convivencia (coexistence) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Iberia. We will pick up the timeline with the emergence of an Ibero-Islamic society in the 8th century CE; the seminar's historical horizon stretches up to the turn of the 16th century, when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of Spain and Portugal. Through a process termed, from a Christian perspective, as reconquista (Reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion, or migrated from one realm to the other. Interactions between the three ethno-religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by mutual respect and shared creativity and others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these religious and cultural encounters, placing them in various historical and geographic contexts. It will raise questions concerning the ambiguities of religious change, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. \nMethodologically, the seminar emphasizes the study of primary sources, including documentary, historiographical, literary and poetical texts. Structurally, the course divides into four main parts. Part 1 will cover the political and cultural history of Iberia from the 8th to the early 16th centuries; part 2 will be devoted to the Jewish experience under Muslim rule; and part 3 to the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Christian Spain. In part 4, we will discuss primary sources originating from each of the three communities that are portraying the respective Other. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. \nThis is the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic, & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors. Graduate students and advanced undergrads in other relevant fields are likewise welcome. ",

Of central importance are the Art Exhibits from Germany and Austria with their cultural-political implications. The German Emperor had a hand in selecting the German paintings to be sent to St. Louis, and his opposition against modern movements like Impressionism caused opposition in Germany. Austria was different: In their Art Nouveau Pavilion they included secessionists (Hagenbund). The Wiener Werkstaetten (Vienna's Workshops) attracted a lot of attention. Different from the paintings, German Arts and Crafts represented avant-garde movements. We will visit libraries, archives, and museums in St. Louis that have World's Fair holdings.

It distinguishes itself from traditional art history by examining visual representations of all types, not only works of high art, and by concentrating on the role those representations play in the formation of culture. Though most of the scholarship produced in this field focuses on the modern world, it depends upon ideas first developed in Mediterranean antiquity. This course has two primary goals. We will conduct an historical examination of practices and theories of image making from Near Eastern antiquity to modernity.  In so doing, we will also carry out an historiographical survey of the major works in Image/Visual Studies, thereby gaining an appreciation for the wide range of methods of inquiry employed in this important field of research.

        "description": "Michelangelo Merisi (Michael Angelo Merigi or Amerighi) da Caravaggio (29 September 1571 - 18 July 1610) was one of the most important and influential painters of the Seventeenth Century, in Italy and throughout Europe.  He was active in Rome, Naples, Malta, and Sicily between ~1592 and 1610.  But who was Caravaggio?  What do we really know about his tempestuous life, and how it factors in the art he created?  Caravaggio was a powerful, brilliant, brutish, and hugely influential artist; a belligerent personality, brawler, and murderer.

But modern art and modern war are qualitatively different from their counterparts in the past in ways that ensured that their relationship would become more problematic and oppositional. The challenge of finding new artistic languages to express the new conditions of mechanized combat led many artists to explore abstraction, fragmentation, absurdity or arbitrariness to convey the energy, impersonality and nihilism of modern war. When the British soldier and poet Wilfred Owen (1893-1918) wrote of the human devastation of World War I as \"obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud,\" he strained for metaphoric language appropriate to its magnitude. We will consider the same challenge to visual artists throughout the modern period.

Topics include: how plants can survive with just water, minerals and light, how they transport water astonishing distances, their unusual sex lives, why they make seeds, how they can grow nearly forever, how plants survive extreme environments without running to hide, why they synthesize caffeine, nicotine, THC and opiates, how they defend themselves from pathogens without an immune system, how they sense their environment without dedicated sensory organs, how plants have been modified by humans to provide food, fiber and fuel, and how genetically modified (GMO) crops are made and their implications to the environment and society. Overall goals are to enhance an understanding and appreciation of the plant kingdom, to help young scientists understand the primary scientific literature, and as a starting point for possible careers in plant biology. Class includes field trips to the Missouri Botanic Gardens and a local plant biotech company/institute.  Where appropriate, the class will also emphasize key differences between plants and animals. This course is primarily for freshmen interested in majoring in biology, with a possible emphasis on plants. This course is also for those that want to know more about where their food comes from, how these amazing creatures survive and flourish, and how GMO crops are engineered.

        "description": "Renewable sources of energy and hybrid vehicles have gained popularity due to the rising environmental crisis caused by the emission of greenhouse gases. Lucky for humans, both wind and solar energy can be captured, stored, and reused at a later time in order to power vehicles, portable electronics, and homes via electrochemical energy storage technologies. Furthermore, energy storage devices possessing extended cyclability capable of instantaneously delivering bursts of electricity, and featuring a high-power energy density, are ideal candidates for controlling interruptions in the transmission of electricity in grids. Not surprisingly, this field of study is very important to society and is the focus of research for a large and vibrant scientific community spanning globally across national laboratories, universities, and private industries. A key component that enables the development of state-of-the-art devices is the synthesis and application of nanostructured materials such as carbon allotropes, metal oxides, and conducting polymers. These nanostructured materials afford enhanced properties such as surface area, directional transport, and conductivity for increasing the efficiency of energy storage. This course will provide an introduction to current synthetic protocols and applications of nanostructured organic, inorganic, and composite materials typically utilized for storing energy. We will focus on the structure and property relationships that are desired for attaining state-of-the-art performance in both pseudocapacitive and capacitive materials. Material characterization via spectroscopy as well as via electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge curves, and electrochemical impedance will be a focus during discussions. Current trends in engineering for device fabrication will also be explored in order to understand how to develop energy storage technologies characterized by both high power density and high energy density.",

In order to do so, we will engage in the writings of Confucius, Mengzi, and Xunzi, three early Chinese writers whose basic ideas about ritual heavily informed myriad cultural practices that are formative for large portions of East Asia today. Hence, this course on ancient thinkers not only introduces thoughts and practices prevalent throughout pre-modern China, Japan, and Korea. It also functions as a catalyst that helps us understand some of the reasons and motivations behind these communities' recent efforts to renegotiate and question \"the colonialist flavor\" of human rights and democracy.",

We will consider some of most important general essays on photography before turning to different moments of photography (primarily pre-digital, still photos) in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. The goal is for you to become aware of how photographs, like other media, have intentionality to them: they want to present their subjects in a \"certain light\"; they want to persuade the viewer.  In this case it is a question of what the photograph wants you to see and believe about East Asia. Your final project will involve either a creative or academic engagement of these issues in a photography of your choice. This will be combined with a group on-line project of \"East Asian Photo Icons\" to begin to address the overwhelming European orientation to definition of the \"iconic photograph.\" No prerequisites; all readings will be in English translation.",

Women played roles as filial daughters, dutiful wives, and devoted mothers, but also as proud courtesans, clever entrepreneurs, educated scholars and teachers, independent nuns, fierce warriors and even powerful rulers.  In this course we will begin with a broad overview of the ideal traditional roles for women established in early China. We will then move on to a general exploration of some of the ways women were represented in classical literature by male writers. Our main focus, however, will be on how, over time, more and more women took up the brush and began to write themselves. In so doing they were able to express their own subjectivity and often radically reinscribe many of the notions of femininity and of female roles that were dominant during their times.  We will conclude with a discussion of ways in which traditional women writers both anticipated and contributed to the 20th century transition to modernity. Most of our class discussion will be based on primary sources in English translation, supplemented by occasional secondary critical scholarly articles where relevant. Prerequisite: Some background in premodern Chinese literature history or culture would be helpful but is not required.",

The course will also explore how youth impact cultural movements in Africa and how they influence the world. In particular, we will examine Hip-Hop movements, sports, and global youth culture developments that center on fashion, dress, dance, and new technologies.

        "description": "The destructive, scandal-ridden career of the Roman emperor Nero (mid-1st century CE) almost defies belief. From his assumption of power as a teenager to his suicide after a military revolt, Nero flouted political and cultural conventions left and right. His inspiring debut notwithstanding, he killed off his family and mentor, held wild parties, poured money into extravagant projects, and neglected state business to pursue a career on stage. He came to be labeled one of the \"Bad Emperors,\" and seen as a symbol of the decline of Rome itself - especially by sympathizers of the Christians he persecuted. Yet Nero as an emperor and a literary character was also a creation of his time. The figure of Nero is examined in his context. The central text is the Life of Nero by Suetonius (2nd century CE), a dense and colorful text read first in its entirety and then more carefully in pieces. Supplementary readings are from the abundant other sources on and interpretations of Nero, both ancient and modern. Discussions and writing assignments are varied and designed to develop analytical and writing skills.",

How and why did ancient Christians take different stances on these issues, and how do these traditions continue to inform sexual ethics and gender roles today? In this class, we will study these questions by examining key passages from the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels, Paul's letters, writings of early church leaders, martyr propaganda, monastic literature, and apocryphal books deemed heretical. We will also consider the interpretations of contemporary historians of religion informed by recent trends in sexuality and gender theories.",

Yet in the process of creating an orthodoxy, what was left out? Whose voices were suppressed? Through careful study of ancient texts long-ago deemed heretical, and virtually lost until the twentieth century, this course examines the wide varieties of Christianity in its nascent years, and how the framers of orthodoxy defined themselves against these alternatives.",

Though most of the scholarship produced in this field focuses on the modern world, it depends upon ideas first developed in Mediterranean antiquity. This course has two primary goals. We will conduct an historical examination of practices and theories of image making from Near Eastern antiquity to modernity.

What is the relationship between friendship and kinship, friendship and desire, friendship and community? And what might happen if we, like Foucault, begin to imagine the socio-political possibilities of friendship \"as a way of life\"?

We will examine how such listening operates on all four levels, and draw relevant conclusions, by focusing on the investigations of Stengers and her frequent collaborator, Bruno Latour, and on several extraordinary poets who in recent decades have demonstrated an especially strong interest in science: A.

Of central importance are the Art Exhibits from Germany and Austria with their cultural-political implications. The German Emperor had a hand in selecting the German paintings to be sent to St. Louis, and his opposition against modern movements like Impressionism caused opposition in Germany. Austria was different: In their Art Nouveau Pavilion they included secessionists (Hagenbund). The Wiener Werkstaetten (Vienna's Workshops) attracted a lot of attention. Different from the paintings, German Arts and Crafts represented avant-garde movements. We will visit libraries, archives, and museums in St. Louis that have World's Fair holdings.

The text itself is complex and layered, responding to its literary precursors, Enlightenment science, radical politics, aesthetic theory, feminism, Romantic idealism, Gothic horror, and more.  In order to understand these influences, we will examine texts read by Mary Shelley (and her characters), including letters, essays, poems, and scientific reports.  Our study of the novel's afterlives will begin with R. B. Peake's 1823 play, Presumption, which shaped much of the popular understanding of the Frankenstein myth during the 19th century.  Our investigation of 20th- and 21st-century manifestations of Frankenstein will focus on its appearance in film, racial discourse, scientific ethics, popular culture, and advertising. This portion of the course will include a viewing of the iconic 1931 Boris Karloff film, which established indelible versions of the mad scientist and his \"monster.\" Students in this seminar will be supported in developing individual final projects of their own design.

Far wider than the concerns of any one national ideology, the literature of record represents a profound crisis in the European cultural imaginary. A number of critical and interpretive issues will be in play in our readings, which will move through three major phases.  We begin with the powerful immediacy of trench poetry (1914-1919), develop into the constructed narratives of the great postwar novels and memoirs (1920-1931), and then turn toward the retrospect of the 1930s, which is also the prospect on the next, now inevitable, war.  The authors featured include combatant and civilian writers, names well-known and not so famous: Mann, Apollinaire, Owen, Pound, Cocteau, H.D., Woolf, Maurois, West, Celine, Joyce, Musil, Eliot, Rosenberg, Sassoon, Graves, Hardy, Trakl, Stramm, Lichtenstein, P\u00e9guy, Barbusse, Manning, J\u00fcnger, Zweig, Brittain, and Kroner.

This graduate-level course will investigate artistic mediations of the Holocaust, focusing in particular on questions of ethics, aesthetics and history and concentrating on two objectives. First, we will examine the various debates and controversies surrounding the issue of artistic representation of the Holocaust and discuss some of the theoretical and philosophical texts that have formed the core of Holocaust Studies by critics such as James Young, Dominick LaCapra, Marianne Hirsch, Sidra Ezrahi, and Geoffrey Hartman. Second, we will explore the ways in which literature and film, both fictional and documentary/testimonial, have attempted to narrate the events of the Holocaust. We will examine exemplary responses to the Shoah in a variety of genres by writers and filmmakers such as Primo Levi, Jean Am\u00e9ry, Jurek Becker, Aaron Appelfeld, Liana Millu, David Grossman, Edgar Hilsenrath, Art Spiegelman, Claude Lanzmann and Alain Resnais. Central to our exploration of these texts will be issues of representation, the role of memory, the problems and limits of language, questions of trauma, the phenomena of postmemory and multidirectional memory, and the notion that a \"master narrative\" of the Holocaust has emerged in public discourse.

We will explore how people create meaning through dance and how dance, in turn, influences social norms, political institutions, aesthetic ideals and cultural practices. As we compare dance forms across the globe, we will also examine issues of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity, analyzing how dance literally embodies identity. At the same time, we will discover how contemporary unequal power hierarchies bear on our designation of some dance forms as \"Western\" and others as \"world\" or \"ethnic.\" Tensions around assessment of authenticity/creativity, adaptation/appropriation, agency/resistance, and cultural hierarchies such as vernacular/modern, shift with social and political hegemony and with the individual's position as insider or outsider relative to ethnic self-identification and traditional forms of expression. The first part of the course introduces the student to different methodological approaches to studying dance. Throughout the semester, the usual process of the course will be discussion of assigned reading and viewing and analyzing together dance videos shown in class. A few dance workshops will be included (for which no previous dance training is necessary). Required work includes a few short assignments, a take-home mid-term exam, a project on a topic of your choice but related to course focus, a 20 minute presentation of your project/paper, and a final take-home exam.",

We will explore the rise of the director, attempts to transform the relationship between stage and audience, and the rising significance of \"the real\" on stage. At the end of the semester, we will examine some late-twentieth-century responses to these modernist experiments; these plays reckon with the massive historical changes of the twentieth century, as well as the stakes of representing history theatrically.

How does film translate or adapt the written word, particularly in a genre as imaginative and fantastical as science fiction?  What is simplified? Or, conversely, magnified? Made more visually expressive but at the same time less ambiguous in meaning?  Comparisons between film and written versions will allow the class to examine closely the unique qualities of each medium of expression, without valuing one over the other.\nFilms and novels to be studied include: The Day the Earth Stood Still; War of the Worlds; Forbidden Planet; 2001; Solaris; Blade Runner; and Starship Trooper.\nThis course will require screenings every other week on Thursdays @ 4pm plus readings of the original novels.",

What is the relationship between friendship and kinship, friendship and desire, friendship and community? And what might happen if we, like Foucault, begin to imagine the socio-political possibilities of friendship \"as a way of life\"? As we read a wide range of literary and theoretical writings about friendship, we will experience the transformation in composition, peer review, and revision when we ask ourselves to think about these practices as intellectual work undertaken by--and for--friends, rather than acquaintances, competitors, or strangers.

First, we examine the Puritan sermon that politicians quote when they describe America as a \"city on a hill.\"  This sermon has been called the \"ur-text\" of American literature, the foundational document of American culture.  Learning and drawing from multiple literary methodologies, we will re-investigate what that sermon means and how it came to tell a story about the Puritan origins of American culture -- a thesis our class will reassess with the help of modern critics.  In the second part of this class, we broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years.  Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day.  Our last days will be spent discussing the rhetoric and legacy of American exceptionalism in the speeches of Obama and Trump.  In the end, students will gain a firm grasp of the long history and continuing significance of this concept in American culture.\n ",

From the end of the Cold War to the sexual scandals that rocked Bill Clinton's presidency, from the emergence of the Internet to the rise of grunge and rap, the 1990s were a time of vast change in American culture. It was period when we, as a nation, reconsidered the legacy of the 1960s, the Reagan revolution, and the end of the Cold War, a time of economic expansion and cultural tension. In our consideration of this period, we will take a multidisciplinary approach when tackling a variety of materials-ranging from literary fiction (Philip Roth's \"The Human Stain,\" Jonathan Franzen's \"The Corrections\") and popular films (Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" and The Cohen brothers' \"The Big Lebowski\") to personal memoir and the music of Nirvana and Public Enemy-in an attempt to come to a better understanding of our recent history. Throughout the semester, we will pursue the vexed cultural, political, and historical questions that Americans faced in the years between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, and consider how literary texts imagined this period of American history. Other possible texts include David Foster Wallace's \"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,\" Joan Didion's \"Political Fictions,\" Toni Morrison's \"Paradise,\" John Updike's \"Rabbit at Rest,\" and Elizabeth Wurtzel's \"Prozac Nation.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

How did rock help to steer the postmodern turn, and why is rap now canonizing itself as an academic poetry through thick anthologies and footnote-heavy artist memoirs? How has American writing's long-running commentary on popular music affected that music's history and mythology--and vice versa?

This course will explore how 21st-century American writers represent and incorporate forms of new media, mostly focusing on the novel but also considering works that experiment with new media platforms and expand our sense of what literature is and can be. How does new media influence the way individuals relate to each other, themselves, the nation, and the world? What kinds of communities, social movements, and political coalitions are made possible? What threats to privacy, democracy, or truth do they pose? From canonical postwar writers to new emerging voices, from the novel to Twitter fiction, we will explore the widening landscapes and evolving shape of contemporary American fiction in the social media age. Potential authors include Thomas Pynchon, Jonathan Franzen, Jennifer Egan, Dave Eggers, Ruth Ozeki, Tao Lin, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Ben Lerner, and Teju Cole.

        "description": "The Stonewall Riots of 1969 are often understood as marking the beginning of a coherent queer culture in the United States. However, long before 1969, U.S. writers such as James Baldwin, Gertrude Stein, Langston Hughes, Willa Cather, and Walt Whitman depicted queer sexuality in their work. In this course, through our readings of fiction, poetry, and drama, we will survey queer literary production before the liberatory moment of Stonewall. During the semester, we will also screen several films, such as the award-winning Capote and the experimental documentary Looking for Langston. Throughout, we will consider a number of questions. What, if anything, is unique about queerness in America? How do American writers represent nonnormative sexualities, in either explicit or coded ways? In what ways did the pre-Stonewall U.S. enable lesbian and gay sexualities, and in what ways did it render those identities unsustainable? How do racial, class, and gender identities intersect with sexual identities? What is queer about the literary forms and styles these writers deployed?

        "description": "Emerging in American films most forcefully during the 1940s, film noir is a cycle of films associated with a distinctive visual style and a cynical worldview. In this course, we will explore the sexual politics of film noir as a distinctive vision of American sexual relations every bit as identifiable as the form's stylized lighting and circuitous storytelling.  We will explore how and why sexual paranoia and perversion seem to animate this genre and why these movies continue to influence \"neo-noir\" filmmaking into the 21st century, even as film noir's representation of gender and sexuality is inseparable from its literary antecedents, most notably, the so-called \"hard-boiled\" school of writing.  We will read examples from this literature by Dashiell Hammett, James Cain, Raymond Chandler and Cornell Woolrich, and discuss these novels and short stories in the context of other artistic and cultural influences on gendered power relations and film noir.  We will also explore the relationship of these films to censorship and to changing post-World War II cultural values.  Films to be screened in complete prints or in excerpts will likely include many of the following: The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Murder My Sweet, Phantom Lady, Strangers on a Train, The Big Sleep, The Killers, Mildred Pierce, The High Wall, Sudden Fear, The Big Combo, Laura, The Glass Key, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, The Crimson Kimono, Touch of Evil, Alphaville, Chinatown, Taxi Driver, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Bad Lieutenant, and Memento.

Overall, the course will investigate how literature might have helped consolidate Empire, as well as ways in which it saw itself as a key mode of rebellion against imperial power, and we will end by considering how the urgent issues of postcolonial literature - race, gender, language, nationalism, identity - continue to haunt today's global literature.

Why did she compare poetry to a fairer house than prose and do all poets believe that poetry is fundamentally different from prose? Did Dickinson, in fact, believe that? These and other questions can guide us as we move from Walt Whitman's radically innovative \"Leaves of Grass,\" composed in the shadow of the impending American Civil War, into the contemporary era. In addition to Whitman (1855-1892) and Dickinson (1830-1886), major stops along the way will include Robert Frost (1874-1963), Marianne Moore (1887-1972), and Langston Hughes (1902-1967). Although these are diverse creative voices, we will be reflecting on their common writerly concerns. The course, then, will study poetry in its biographical and cultural context from the American Renaissance of the 1850s to the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and beyond. Whenever possible, we will listen to recordings of our poets reading from their work. Frost, for example, who loved to perform in public, developed an elaborate theory of \"the sound of sense.\" What did he mean by it and what other sounds did this theory exclude?",

We will examine how such listening operates on all four levels, and draw relevant conclusions, by focusing on the investigations of Stengers and her frequent collaborator, Bruno Latour, and on several extraordinary poets who in recent decades have demonstrated an especially strong interest in science: A.

How does whiteness intersect with related discourses of gender, sexuality, and social class? Beginning with the apocalyptic poetry and prose of Edgar Allan Poe, we will examine terrorized whiteness as an identifying feature of normative masculinity in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Henry James, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Do these authors claim the power to resist threats to their individual autonomy? To what extent do they experience masculine self-reliance as a myth? How do they imagine meaningful communities?

In order to understand these influences, we will examine texts read by Mary Shelley (and her characters), including letters, essays, poems, and scientific reports.  Our study of the novel's afterlives will begin with R. B. Peake's 1823 play, Presumption, which shaped much of the popular understanding of the Frankenstein myth during the 19th century.  Our investigation of 20th- and 21st-century manifestations of Frankenstein will focus on its appearance in film, racial discourse, scientific ethics, popular culture, and advertising.

We will trace the imbrication of emotion and capitalism (Hochschilds); the relation between affective labor and \"women's work\" in post-Fordism (Weeks), the racialization of emotion (Ahmed) and its globalization through the care industry (Sassen). The main assignment for the course will be to write a 6,000 words essay titled \"Affect in Feminist Theory.\" Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

        "description": "The Great War of 1914-1918 is one of the most momentous events in history.  We can approach its broad European import by reading its literatures comparatively.  Far wider than the concerns of any one national ideology, the literature of record represents a profound crisis in the European cultural imaginary. A number of critical and interpretive issues will be in play in our readings, which will move through three major phases.  We begin with the powerful immediacy of trench poetry (1914-1919), develop into the constructed narratives of the great postwar novels and memoirs (1920-1931), and then turn toward the retrospect of the 1930s, which is also the prospect on the next, now inevitable, war.  The authors featured include combatant and civilian writers, names well-known and not so famous: Mann, Apollinaire, Owen, Pound, Cocteau, H.D., Woolf, Maurois, West, Celine, Joyce, Musil, Eliot, Rosenberg, Sassoon, Graves, Hardy, Trakl, Stramm, Lichtenstein, P\u00e9guy, Barbusse, Manning, J\u00fcnger, Zweig, Brittain, and Kroner.  All readings for class will be in English translation.  Our secondary literature will provide approaches to specific texts and models of literary and cultural history that represent the longer-range importance of the war.",

        "description": "American literary study has not shouted from the rooftops about authoritarianism. In the U.S. context, largely resistant to the fascist temptation of the 1930s, Orwellian and other anti-totalitarian allegories have been for high schoolers; Hitler, Mussolini, and company enter as distant topics only in discussions of the Pound Era, the Frankfurt School, and some Foucauldian biopolitics; and the assumed enemy of most varieties of radical interpretation has been the naive liberal rather than the Stalinist apparatchik or Nazi collaborator.  Despite the relative indifference of academic criticism, however, a significant vein of 20th- and 21st-century American writing indeed grapples with authoritarianism's causes and consequences and imagines what might unfold if it found a foothold here. This seminar aims to introduce students to three main lines in this vein: historical narratives from Richard Hofstadter's classic essay \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\" (1964) to Nancy Isenberg's Trumpsplaining book \"White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America\" (2016); theoretical accounts from Hannah Arendt's first American publication, \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" (1951), to Vaughn Rasberry's \"Race and the Totalitarian Century\" (2016); and creative dystopian fictions from Sinclair Lewis's \"It Can't Happen Here\" (1935)--the inspiration for the class title--to Gary Shteyngart's tragically hilarious \"Super Sad True Love Story\" (2010). These readings will help us tackle a number of pressing questions about responsible literary study, not to mention informed citizenship, after November 2016.  What will become of canons and syllabi of American exceptionalism--of the left as well as of the right--amid an international wave of reactionary neo-nationalism? What does the unexpected emergence of an influential, explicitly anti-intellectual alt-right in the U.S. mean for the willfully progressive projects of feminist criticism, disability studies, critical race studies, and queer theory? Should \"paranoid reading\" now mount a principled comeback?",

In order to do so, we will engage in the writings of Confucius, Mengzi, and Xunzi, three early Chinese writers whose basic ideas about ritual heavily informed myriad cultural practices that are formative for large portions of East Asia today. Hence, this course on ancient thinkers not only introduces thoughts and practices prevalent throughout pre-modern China, Japan, and Korea. It also functions as a catalyst that helps us understand some of the reasons and motivations behind these communities' recent efforts to renegotiate and question \"the colonialist flavor\" of human rights and democracy.",

In this case it is a question of what the photograph wants you to see and believe about East Asia. Your final project will involve either a creative or academic engagement of these issues in a photography of your choice.

From its colonization by Japan, to its suffering of a civil war within the cold war order, to its growth into a cultural and economic powerhouse, Korea's historical experience is at once unique and typical of that of a third-world nation.  By immersing ourselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, we examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultutral production.  In class discussion, we pay special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation.  How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self?  And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation?  Along the way, we observe the prominent ideas, themes, and genres of Korean literature.  This class combines discussion with lecture with students strongly encouraged to participate.

In particular, we will observe how various religious texts, short stories, and plays from China's earliest times until the sixteenth century depicted the interactions of the living and the dead. Despite the distinct genres, time periods, and topics, one important aspect will regularly appear: apparently people perceived the boundaries between the living and the dead to be quite porous in pre-modern China. In other words, the dead seemed to have played as much of a role in society and everyday life as living family members, friends, and government officials.",

This course provides an introduction to those iconoclastic filmmakers, who went on to break with major studios and revolutionize oppositional filmmaking in Japan. We will analyze the challenging politics and aesthetics of these confrontational films for what they tell us about Japan's modern history and cinema. The films provoke as well as entertain, providing trenchant (sometimes absurd) commentaries on postwar Japanese society and its transformations. Themes include: the legacy of WWII and Japanese imperialism; the student movement; juvenile delinquency; sexual liberation; and Tokyo subcultures. Directors include: Oshima Nagisa, Shinoda Masahiro, Terayama Shuji, Masumura Yasuzo, Suzuki Seijun, Matsumoto Toshio, and others. No knowledge of Japanese necessary. Credit 3 units.

        "description": "Although women of premodern China have often been portrayed as little more than long-suffering victims of male patriarchy and sexual repression, their lives were far more complicated, diverse, and interesting.  Women played roles as filial daughters, dutiful wives, and devoted mothers, but also as proud courtesans, clever entrepreneurs, educated scholars and teachers, independent nuns, fierce warriors and even powerful rulers.  In this course we will begin with a broad overview of the ideal traditional roles for women established in early China. We will then move on to a general exploration of some of the ways women were represented in classical literature by male writers. Our main focus, however, will be on how, over time, more and more women took up the brush and began to write themselves. In so doing they were able to express their own subjectivity and often radically reinscribe many of the notions of femininity and of female roles that were dominant during their times.  We will conclude with a discussion of ways in which traditional women writers both anticipated and contributed to the 20th century transition to modernity. Most of our class discussion will be based on primary sources in English translation, supplemented by occasional secondary critical scholarly articles where relevant.

The goal is for you to become aware of how photographs, like other media, have intentionality to them: they want to present their subjects in a \"certain light\"; they want to persuade the viewer.  In this case it is a question of what the photograph wants you to see and believe about East Asia. Your final project will involve either a creative or academic engagement of these issues in a photography of your choice. This will be combined with a group on-line project of \"East Asian Photo Icons\" to begin to address the overwhelming European orientation to definition of the \"iconic photograph.\" No prerequisites; all readings will be in English translation.",

This course is your initial study of econometric theory and practice. Topics include: translation of economic theory into statistical models, statistical foundations of econometrics, preregression analysis bivariate and multiple regression techniques, hypothesis testing, multicollinearity, specification error, autocorrelation, errors in variables, identification, and simultaneous estimation. The 3 writing assignments and the final paper will provide you an opportunity to formulate an economic model, estimate the model with appropriate data, and interpret the results. This experience will help you understand how econometrics relates to other upper-level economics courses which focus on theoretical models for how the world operates. Econometrics provides a method of testing the validity of these economic models, and the term paper will improve your writing skills, giving you a chance to write clearly and concisely about technical material.

In addition, we examine, 1) the impact of resource access - material, human, and symbolic - on teaching and learning experiences; 2) how poverty and race, for example, shape educational opportunity; and 3) the ways in which school and classroom interactions contribute to students' identity formation - as learners and as linked to future roles they may enact in society. The course challenges us to consider whether schooling is in fact a means for social mobility for all students, particularly those most marginalized by society. The course themes consider the multiple types of schools including, for example, comprehensive neighborhood, charter and magnet public schools.

Major questions extending from this course feature include: What is public policy, policy behavior, its defining processes/features and what social function does it serve? Second, the course emphasizes the skills related to the exercise of policy analysis. These skills include the crafting of technical documents within the field of public policy (e.g. a policy brief) and the application of scientific methods to the exploration of social problems/governmental actions. Likely issues related to this course feature include the use of scientific knowledge in political arenas, engagement with stakeholders and the intended/unintended consequences of policy science to political decision-making. Third, this course simulates the policymaking context through students' participation in mock congressional testimonies. These focal areas will become central to an understanding of four social concerns: school desegregation following the Brown decisions; affirmative action in higher education; Head Start programs and/or the ESEA Act of 1965, also known as No Child Left Behind.

Engineering and Arts & Sciences students participate in interdisciplinary teams with law students, handling environmental projects for public interest, environmental or community organizations or individuals. Students from other schools may also participate with permission of instructors. Projects may involve the following activities: representing clients in federal and state court litigation and administrative proceedings; drafting proposed legislation; commenting on proposed regulations, permits, environmental impact statements or environmental assessments, and similar documents; and evaluating matters for potential future action. The goal is that for each project, students will have primary responsibility for handling the matter, and faculty will play a secondary, supervisory role. Non-law students may provide such technical support as investigating unknown facts, evaluating facts presented by other parties (such as in government reports), and working with law students to develop and present facts relevant to an understanding of and resolution of the matter. Units: Variable (3 min/6 max). For 3 units, students must work an average of 12 hours per week on clinic matters, including attendance at and participation each week in: at least one individual meeting with the professor; one group meeting involving the student team assigned to each project and the professors; and a two-hour seminar for all students in the clinic. For each additional unit, students must work 3 additional hours per week on clinic matters. Prerequisites: The clinic is open to graduate students and upper-level undergraduates with coursework and/or experience in environmental engineering, environmental science, or related fields. Additional information: Students who register for the clinic are required to submit a resume and a brief statement of interest to Clinic Scientist Ken Miller at kenneth.miller@wustl.edu. Enrollment is limited to 8 students. All students will be placed on the waitlist upon registration and students will be selected to enroll from the waitlist.",

At the beginning we will deal with the historical development that lead to the purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, will review the developments of World's Fairs since 1851 and will have a look at the grand dimension of the 1904 World's Fair (connected with the Olympic Games). Of central importance are the Art Exhibits from Germany and Austria with their cultural-political implications. The German Emperor had a hand in selecting the German paintings to be sent to St. Louis, and his opposition against modern movements like Impressionism caused opposition in Germany. Austria was different: In their Art Nouveau Pavilion they included secessionists (Hagenbund). The Wiener Werkstaetten (Vienna's Workshops) attracted a lot of attention. Different from the paintings, German Arts and Crafts represented avant-garde movements. We will visit libraries, archives, and museums in St. Louis that have World's Fair holdings.

Far wider than the concerns of any one national ideology, the literature of record represents a profound crisis in the European cultural imaginary. A number of critical and interpretive issues will be in play in our readings, which will move through three major phases.  We begin with the powerful immediacy of trench poetry (1914-1919), develop into the constructed narratives of the great postwar novels and memoirs (1920-1931), and then turn toward the retrospect of the 1930s, which is also the prospect on the next, now inevitable, war.  The authors featured include combatant and civilian writers, names well-known and not so famous: Mann, Apollinaire, Owen, Pound, Cocteau, H.D., Woolf, Maurois, West, Celine, Joyce, Musil, Eliot, Rosenberg, Sassoon, Graves, Hardy, Trakl, Stramm, Lichtenstein, P\u00e9guy, Barbusse, Manning, J\u00fcnger, Zweig, Brittain, and Kroner.  All readings for class will be in English translation.  Our secondary literature will provide approaches to specific texts and models of literary and cultural history that represent the longer-range importance of the war.",

The story may involve aliens, androids, space travel or other worlds, but the original imagery and inspiration comes from the written word.  How does film translate or adapt the written word, particularly in a genre as imaginative and fantastical as science fiction?  What is simplified? Or, conversely, magnified? Made more visually expressive but at the same time less ambiguous in meaning?  Comparisons between film and written versions will allow the class to examine closely the unique qualities of each medium of expression, without valuing one over the other.\nFilms and novels to be studied include: The Day the Earth Stood Still; War of the Worlds; Forbidden Planet; 2001; Solaris; Blade Runner; and Starship Trooper.\nThis course will require screenings every other week on Thursdays @ 4pm plus readings of the original novels.",

Why are audiences attracted to a genre that causes fear, revulsion, and distress? This course will consider the cultural, philosophical and generic dimensions of horror and explore how it operates across an array of media platforms:  film, literature, television, comics, and video games. We will read two literary masters of the genre, H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King and screen some of the most successful horror films of the last 50 years. We will also study horror through a variety of critical frameworks including gender, stardom, special effects, transnationality, adaptation, transmedia storytelling, and interactivity. The course will culminate in two extended case studies. In the first, we will compare and contrast literary, filmic, and televisual adaptations of The Shining. In the second, we will consider The Walking Dead as a franchise that spreads its narrative across comics, multiple television programs, and video games. Required Screenings: Mondays @ 7 pm.",

In this course, we will explore the sexual politics of film noir as a distinctive vision of American sexual relations every bit as identifiable as the form's stylized lighting and circuitous storytelling.  We will explore how and why sexual paranoia and perversion seem to animate this genre and why these movies continue to influence \"neo-noir\" filmmaking into the 21st century, even as film noir's representation of gender and sexuality is inseparable from its literary antecedents, most notably, the so-called \"hard-boiled\" school of writing.  We will read examples from this literature by Dashiell Hammett, James Cain, Raymond Chandler and Cornell Woolrich, and discuss these novels and short stories in the context of other artistic and cultural influences on gendered power relations and film noir.  We will also explore the relationship of these films to censorship and to changing post-World War II cultural values.  Films to be screened in complete prints or in excerpts will likely include many of the following: The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Murder My Sweet, Phantom Lady, Strangers on a Train, The Big Sleep, The Killers, Mildred Pierce, The High Wall, Sudden Fear, The Big Combo, Laura, The Glass Key, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, The Crimson Kimono, Touch of Evil, Alphaville, Chinatown, Taxi Driver, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Bad Lieutenant, and Memento.

However, the phenomenon of media convergence has taken on a special salience over the last one-and-a-half-centuries, as exemplified by the growing intermixture of film, radio, television, gaming, and the internet. In particular, critics, consumers, politicians, and producers used convergence as structuring principle in understanding, regulating, and planning for the future of media culture. This course engages with contemporary worries and enthusiasms about convergence by considering the specific conditions in which the phenomenon has been understood and practiced. Tracing a historical arc though the Twentieth Century, we will first examine convergences of radio and film, film and music publishing, television and film exhibition, and disparate corporate entities as basis for understanding more recent media combinations. Building on that foundation, the majority of the course will consist of case studies of media convergence since 1980, considering it in terms of industry, technology, regulation, and audiences. These case studies will also provide students with a survey of and inquiry into questions of historiographic theory and method.

We will analyze the challenging politics and aesthetics of these confrontational films for what they tell us about Japan's modern history and cinema.

Themes include: the legacy of WWII and Japanese imperialism; the student movement; juvenile delinquency; sexual liberation; and Tokyo subcultures.

The practicum may take a number of forms, but in every case, the experience must be planned in a way that contributes to the student's professional development.  It might consist of work curating films for a screening or mini-festival accompanied by screening notes or other activities that enhance the academic value of the event.  The student might organize a reading group or a scholarly symposium or lecture series to further the understanding of a particular aspect of the moving image on campus. The practicum may also consist of archival, or curatorial work in forms of the moving image at an archive, museum, or other non-profit organization (such as the St. Louis International Film Festival). The student might also pursue a film/media-centered oral history project or develop a film/media-centered blog or engage in other forms of writing that have a public presence.  Students may initiate other projects, but any practicum requires a faculty mentor and in circumstances in which there is a collaborating organization, a letter of endorsement of the practicum from the student's on-site supervisor.  Every student presents a written proposal/plan for any practicum to the DGS and to the faculty mentor/advisor.  Both faculty must give permission to the plan and determine the appropriate number of credit hours (variable 1 to 3).  Students may sign up for the practicum more than once to satisfy the 3 credits required in this area for the FMS master's degree; however, only one practicum should be pursued in a given semester. If there is a site supervisor, she/he must provide a letter upon completion of the practicum detailing the student's work and its quality. The student must provide a brief narrative (2 to 5 pages) detailing how the practicum served as a learning experience.  The faculty advisor will award the grade for the practicum.

This is the period of an emerging cultural nationalism, a great efflorescence of literature in many genres, and some of the most important political, social, and military events in modern Irish history.  One of the remarkable things about the period is the close relationship between prominent figures in the literary and artistic world and those in the realm of politics and social change.  The result was a rich cross-fertilization of ideas and attitudes which had enormous implications for the future of this embattled island nation.  We will explore this vital and transformative exchange by close attention to some primary texts of the period.  Writers to be studied will include: Yeats, Gregory, Wilde, Synge, Shaw, Joyce, O'Casey, and Bowen.  Prerequisite: Admission into The Ireland FOCUS program.",

Why did Germany turn to a dictatorship of racism, war, and mass murder? Why did the Nazis see Jews as the supreme enemy, while also targeting Poles, Ukranians, Soviets, homosexuals, the Roma, and the disabled? The course introduces students to issues that are central to understanding Nazi occupation and extermination regimes. Students will look at survival strategies in Western Europe including emigration, resistance movements in Eastern European ghettos, local residents' reactions to the murder in their midst, and non-European governments' reactions.",

Of central importance are the Art Exhibits from Germany and Austria with their cultural-political implications. The German Emperor had a hand in selecting the German paintings to be sent to St. Louis, and his opposition against modern movements like Impressionism caused opposition in Germany. Austria was different: In their Art Nouveau Pavilion they included secessionists (Hagenbund). The Wiener Werkstaetten (Vienna's Workshops) attracted a lot of attention. Different from the paintings, German Arts and Crafts represented avant-garde movements. We will visit libraries, archives, and museums in St. Louis that have World's Fair holdings.

        "description": "Whether oral or written, whether everyday or literary elevated storytelling, whether books, films, plays, opera, or dance, much of our experience is condensed in stories. As studies in the field of narrative psychology and cognitive theory have shown, there is good reason to assume that the way we experience our environment is based on preconscious, proto-narrative scripts that help us guide our way through the complexities of our everyday world. But how do we tell stories? And did humans at all times tell stories in the same or similar ways? In this seminar, we will explore how twelfth- and early-thirteenth-century literary cultures, in Germany, moulded their experiences as narrative. We will look at the specifics of medieval German storytelling, study contemporary tools of narrative theory, and ask if and to what extent they are applicable to pre-modern narrative. Possible readings include: excerpts from the so-called \"Spielmannsepik\" (K\u00f6nig Rother, Herzog Ernst); medieval heroic epics (the German Rolandslied, the Nibelungenlied); Middle High German Arthurian romance (Hartmann von Aue, Wolfram von Eschenbach). Through short introductory modules on Middle High German, the course also enables students without previous exposure to medieval German to read and interpret the texts in their original language.",

We will consider literature and canon-formation, painting, monuments, school plays, school readers, and books for children, examining them for the myths, values, and patriotic images espoused by those promoting national culture. Affirmative cultural artifacts and phenomena will be contrasted with literary works that give voice to discontent and unease with developments after 1871.\u00a0Throughout we will discuss the continued uncomfortable presence of the French in and French influence on the German imaginary as well as the discomfort that integrating disparate territories within the Empire creates, where natives of one province are strangers in another and where members of ethnic subgroups figure as strangers. We will also examine the new awareness of alien peoples and places beyond continental Europe in the wake of Germany's belated colonialism. Finally we will consider how modern times, figured as strangers and strangeness, obstruct and intrude in the formation and maintenance of conservative imperial culture. Authors treated include Fontane, Thomas Mann, Raabe, Reuter, Storm, Viebig, Wagner, and others.\u00a0Reading in German, discussion in English.",

This graduate-level course will investigate artistic mediations of the Holocaust, focusing in particular on questions of ethics, aesthetics and history and concentrating on two objectives. First, we will examine the various debates and controversies surrounding the issue of artistic representation of the Holocaust and discuss some of the theoretical and philosophical texts that have formed the core of Holocaust Studies by critics such as James Young, Dominick LaCapra, Marianne Hirsch, Sidra Ezrahi, and Geoffrey Hartman. Second, we will explore the ways in which literature and film, both fictional and documentary/testimonial, have attempted to narrate the events of the Holocaust. We will examine exemplary responses to the Shoah in a variety of genres by writers and filmmakers such as Primo Levi, Jean Am\u00e9ry, Jurek Becker, Aaron Appelfeld, Liana Millu, David Grossman, Edgar Hilsenrath, Art Spiegelman, Claude Lanzmann and Alain Resnais. Central to our exploration of these texts will be issues of representation, the role of memory, the problems and limits of language, questions of trauma, the phenomena of postmemory and multidirectional memory, and the notion that a \"master narrative\" of the Holocaust has emerged in public discourse.  Designed for graduate and advanced undergraduate students; undergraduate enrollment only with express permission of instructor.

The demographic revolution you're going to live through will change the health care you receive, the house you live in, the car you drive, the jobs you do, and the relationships you have. This class will give you a competitive edge in understanding how you can harness what's happening to shape your career and lifestyle. In class you'll be introduced to leaders and ideas from many fields - medicine, engineering, architecture, public health, social work, law, business, art, and psychology - focused on the issues of our aging society. There will also be opportunities to tailor the class to your interests through events on and off campus, including movies, lectures, performances, field trips, and community projects. Each week, we'll gather for lectures and also break into small groups for discussion. This course will set you on a path to lead the aging revolution and transform the society of tomorrow.

        "description": "Jewish literature includes a number of highly fascinating travel accounts and autobiographies that are still awaiting their discovery by a broader readership. In this course, we will explore a broad range of texts originating from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. They were written by both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews hailing from countries as diverse as Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy business woman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled.\nSpecifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an \"other,\" against which and through which they define a particular sense of self? To what extent are these texts reliable accounts of their authors' personal experiences, and where do they serve their own self-fashioning? How do the writers portray Christians, Muslims, and Jews from other cultural backgrounds than their own? How do they construe the role of women in a world dominated by men? How do they reflect on history, geography, and other fields of knowledge that were not covered by the traditional Jewish curriculum; and how do they respond to the challenges and opportunities of early modernity? \nThis course is open to students of varying interests, including Jewish, Islamic, or Religious Studies, medieval and early modern history, European or Near Eastern literatures. All texts will be read in English translation. ",

        "description": "This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore in some depth various facets of the convivencia (coexistence) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Iberia. We will pick up the timeline with the emergence of an Ibero-Islamic society in the 8th century CE; the seminar's historical horizon stretches up to the turn of the 16th century, when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of Spain and Portugal. Through a process termed, from a Christian perspective, as reconquista (Reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion, or migrated from one realm to the other. Interactions between the three ethno-religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by mutual respect and shared creativity and others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these religious and cultural encounters, placing them in various historical and geographic contexts. It will raise questions concerning the ambiguities of religious change, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. \nMethodologically, the seminar emphasizes the study of primary sources, including documentary, historiographical, literary and poetical texts. Structurally, the course divides into four main parts. Part 1 will cover the political and cultural history of Iberia from the 8th to the early 16th centuries; part 2 will be devoted to the Jewish experience under Muslim rule; and part 3 to the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Christian Spain. In part 4, we will discuss primary sources originating from each of the three communities that are portraying the respective Other. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. \nThis is the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic, & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors. Graduate students and advanced undergrads in other relevant fields are likewise welcome. ",

The main goals of this course are to understand the many different methods and standards applied to the past; to understand how and why each generation changes the past as it seeks to make it \"usable\"; and to develop the skills of exposition and argumentation necessary to describe and analyze complex historical issues and to express critical ideas effectively. The subject of this inquiry will be the Nuremberg trials - the innovations and critiques around the law and politics of the trials themselves, as well as the trials' legacies for ideas about international justice in postwar America and the world. Course requirements include a 15 page research paper and a series of short reaction papers to the assigned readings.",

A central aim of the Nazi project was the destruction of European Jewry, the killing of people, and the annihilation of a cultural heritage. This course seeks to deal with questions that, some sixty years after what is now known as the Holocaust, still continue to perplex. Why did Germany turn to a dictatorship of racism, war, and mass murder? Why did the Nazis see Jews as the supreme enemy, while also targeting Poles, Ukranians, Soviets, homosexuals, the Roma, and the disabled? The course introduces students to issues that are central to understanding Nazi occupation and extermination regimes. Students will look at survival strategies in Western Europe including emigration, resistance movements in Eastern European ghettos, local residents' reactions to the murder in their midst, and non-European governments' reactions.",

First, we examine the Puritan sermon that politicians quote when they describe America as a \"city on a hill.\"  This sermon has been called the \"ur-text\" of American literature, the foundational document of American culture.  Learning and drawing from multiple literary methodologies, we will re-investigate what that sermon means and how it came to tell a story about the Puritan origins of American culture -- a thesis our class will reassess with the help of modern critics.  In the second part of this class, we broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years.  Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day.  Our last days will be spent discussing the rhetoric and legacy of American exceptionalism in the speeches of Obama and Trump.  In the end, students will gain a firm grasp of the long history and continuing significance of this concept in American culture.\n ",

In this course, we participate in this national project of history-making by helping to excavate the queer past in the greater St. Louis region. Course readings will focus on the ways that sexual identities and communities in the United States have been shaped by urban settings since the late nineteenth century, with particular attention to the ways that race, class and gender have structured queer spaces and communities. In their community service project, students will work with the grassroots St. Louis LGBT History Project to research St. Louis's queer past, including conducting oral histories with local LGBTQ elders. IMPORTANT NOTE:  This is a service-learning class, which means it combines classroom learning with outside work at a community organization.   In addition to regular class time, there is a service requirement, which will necessitate an additional 3-4 hours a week. Before beginning community service students must complete required training.

In this course, we will explore a broad range of texts originating from the Middle Ages to the 19th century.

Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy business woman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled.\nSpecifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an \"other,\" against which and through which they define a particular sense of self? To what extent are these texts reliable accounts of their authors' personal experiences, and where do they serve their own self-fashioning? How do the writers portray Christians, Muslims, and Jews from other cultural backgrounds than their own? How do they construe the role of women in a world dominated by men? How do they reflect on history, geography, and other fields of knowledge that were not covered by the traditional Jewish curriculum; and how do they respond to the challenges and opportunities of early modernity? \nThis course is open to students of varying interests, including Jewish, Islamic, or Religious Studies, medieval and early modern history, European or Near Eastern literatures.

The remainder of the course focuses on aspects of the cultural, economic, political and social experiences of Caribbean peoples during the twentieth century. Major areas of inquiry include the labor rebellions of the 1930s, decolonization, diasporic alliances, Black Power, identity construction and the politics of tourism. While the English-speaking Caribbean constitutes the main focus, references will be made to other areas such as Cuba and Haiti. Additionally, the Caribbean will be considered in a multilayered way with a view to investigating the local (actors within national boundaries), the regional (historical events that have rendered the region a unit of analysis) and the global (larger globalizing forces such as capitalism, colonialism, migration and slavery that have made the Caribbean central to world history).

        "description": "Between 1957 and 1975, one African territory after another made the transition from European colony to independent nation state. Widespread optimism that these \"transfers of power\" would bring a new era of prosperity and dignity dissipated quickly as the new nations struggled with political instability, military coups, social unrest, and persistent poverty. Consequently many western observers and development specialists are certain that they have become \"failed states\" requiring foreign assistance to develop properly.  This course challenges these assumptions by tracing the origins of African governance and economic development from their imperial origins into the independence era.  By exploring nation-building, economic planning, and public administration from the perspective of political elites, foreign experts, and ordinary people the class takes an intimate look at how colonies became nation states. These new perspectives offer students a historical grounding in international public administration and development by exploring how imperial ideas and concepts continue to influence contemporary social planning and development policy in both Africa and the wider world.

        "description": "This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore in some depth various facets of the convivencia (coexistence) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Iberia. We will pick up the timeline with the emergence of an Ibero-Islamic society in the 8th century CE; the seminar's historical horizon stretches up to the turn of the 16th century, when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of Spain and Portugal. Through a process termed, from a Christian perspective, as reconquista (Reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion, or migrated from one realm to the other. Interactions between the three ethno-religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by mutual respect and shared creativity and others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these religious and cultural encounters, placing them in various historical and geographic contexts. It will raise questions concerning the ambiguities of religious change, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. \nMethodologically, the seminar emphasizes the study of primary sources, including documentary, historiographical, literary and poetical texts. Structurally, the course divides into four main parts. Part 1 will cover the political and cultural history of Iberia from the 8th to the early 16th centuries; part 2 will be devoted to the Jewish experience under Muslim rule; and part 3 to the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Christian Spain. In part 4, we will discuss primary sources originating from each of the three communities that are portraying the respective Other. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. \nThis is the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic, & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors. Graduate students and advanced undergrads in other relevant fields are likewise welcome. ",

The text itself is complex and layered, responding to its literary precursors, Enlightenment science, radical politics, aesthetic theory, feminism, Romantic idealism, Gothic horror, and more.  In order to understand these influences, we will examine texts read by Mary Shelley (and her characters), including letters, essays, poems, and scientific reports.  Our study of the novel's afterlives will begin with R. B. Peake's 1823 play, Presumption, which shaped much of the popular understanding of the Frankenstein myth during the 19th century.  Our investigation of 20th- and 21st-century manifestations of Frankenstein will focus on its appearance in film, racial discourse, scientific ethics, popular culture, and advertising. This portion of the course will include a viewing of the iconic 1931 Boris Karloff film, which established indelible versions of the mad scientist and his \"monster.\" Students in this seminar will be supported in developing individual final projects of their own design.

We will spend time engaging in a historical analysis of the social, economic, and racial dynamics that defined drug addiction in popular imagination, and examine how these factors contributed to discussions about legality, access to substances, one's ability to be rehabilitated, and criminal status. Regarding criminality we will particularly explore sociological and theoretical perspectives of labeling, habitual and occasional offenders, and moral panic in order to understand how racial minority groups were targeted for different rhetorical, legislative, and economic purposes. One major goal of the course will be to outline the early 20th century beginnings of the war on drugs and connect it to the century long growth of a militarized police system and prison industrial complex. We will secondly work to understand the role of local and national political actors, law enforcement, and the media in manufacturing and maintaining connections between race, crime and drugs. Ultimately, we will use our study of drugs to contextualize 21st century issues of police violence, increases in homicide in minority communities, mass incarceration, poverty, segregation, and mass movements of protest.

In order to do so, we will engage in the writings of Confucius, Mengzi, and Xunzi, three early Chinese writers whose basic ideas about ritual heavily informed myriad cultural practices that are formative for large portions of East Asia today. Hence, this course on ancient thinkers not only introduces thoughts and practices prevalent throughout pre-modern China, Japan, and Korea. It also functions as a catalyst that helps us understand some of the reasons and motivations behind these communities' recent efforts to renegotiate and question \"the colonialist flavor\" of human rights and democracy.",

In this case it is a question of what the photograph wants you to see and believe about East Asia. Your final project will involve either a creative or academic engagement of these issues in a photography of your choice.

The Olmec civilization and the civilization of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico will be considered as they related to the rise and development of the Maya civilization.  The ancient Maya were the only Pre-Columbian civilization to leave us a written record that we can use to understand their politics, religion, and history.  This course is about Maya ancient history and Maya glyphic texts, combined with the images of Maya life from their many forms of art.  The combination of glyphic texts, art, and archaeology now can provide a uniquely detailed reconstruction of ancient history in a New World civilization.",

The world's largest secular democracy since independence in 1947, India has witnessed the rising ascendancy of the Hindu Right since the early 1990s.  In its wake, the Hindu Right has brought violence against minorities; curbs on free speech; and moves toward second-class citizenship for Indian Muslims. This course will track the history of the Hindu Right in India from its nineteenth century roots to the present. The struggle to come to grips with the Hindu Right is of immediate political relevance. And it raises big questions in the study of religion and secularism.",

The course will seek to develop an understanding of each individual film both as an expression of a national culture as well as a possible response to international movements in other art forms.  Throughout, the course will consider how various national cinemas sought ways of dealing with the pervasiveness of Hollywood films, developing their own distinctive styles, which could in turn influence American cinema itself.

During the 20th century Korea went through a radical process of modernization.  From its colonization by Japan, to its suffering of a civil war within the cold war order, to its growth into a cultural and economic powerhouse, Korea's historical experience is at once unique and typical of that of a third-world nation.  By immersing ourselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, we examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultutral production.  In class discussion, we pay special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation.  How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self?  And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation?  Along the way, we observe the prominent ideas, themes, and genres of Korean literature.  This class combines discussion with lecture with students strongly encouraged to participate.  All literary texts are in English translation and no previous knowledge of Korean is required.",

We will explore the rise of the director, attempts to transform the relationship between stage and audience, and the rising significance of \"the real\" on stage. At the end of the semester, we will examine some late-twentieth-century responses to these modernist experiments; these plays reckon with the massive historical changes of the twentieth century, as well as the stakes of representing history theatrically.

Widespread optimism that these \"transfers of power\" would bring a new era of prosperity and dignity dissipated quickly as the new nations struggled with political instability, military coups, social unrest, and persistent poverty. Consequently many western observers and development specialists are certain that they have become \"failed states\" requiring foreign assistance to develop properly.  This course challenges these assumptions by tracing the origins of African governance and economic development from their imperial origins into the independence era.  By exploring nation-building, economic planning, and public administration from the perspective of political elites, foreign experts, and ordinary people the class takes an intimate look at how colonies became nation states. These new perspectives offer students a historical grounding in international public administration and development by exploring how imperial ideas and concepts continue to influence contemporary social planning and development policy in both Africa and the wider world.

What do we mean when we speak of ethnic identities and ethnic mobilization? Why and how does salience of ethnic identities change over time and space? What are the political consequences of ethnic divisions? These are some of the main questions we will cover during the semester. We will start the semester with an exploration of the meaning of ethnic identity and the factors that motivate individuals to develop attachments to ethnic groups. We will then turn to discussing when, why and how ethnicity matters in politics. We will study different theories of ethnically based identification and mobilization. We will then move on to examine different types of ethnic conflict, ranging from ethnic violence in civil war to ethnic riots. Theoretical readings will be supplemented with empirical studies from developed and developing countries across different time periods.",

How do contemporary wars against \"terror\" reproduce the assumptions of civilizational difference that drove earlier colonial wars? What makes deaths of Arabs/Muslims at the hands of war largely unrecognized? And how do assumptions about Middle Eastern patriarchy and homophobia justify and even incite wars in the name of humanity? Sophomore standing required.",

What options remained for them (particularly for Jews or members of other targeted groups) after Hitler's rise to power? Through this examination we will seek to develop a better understanding of how fascism happens, and what responses are possible. Authors and artists will include Joseph Roth, Bertolt Brecht, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Theodor Adorno, Hannah Arendt, George Grosz, John Heartfield, and Victor Klemperer.

Of central importance are the Art Exhibits from Germany and Austria with their cultural-political implications. The German Emperor had a hand in selecting the German paintings to be sent to St. Louis, and his opposition against modern movements like Impressionism caused opposition in Germany. Austria was different: In their Art Nouveau Pavilion they included secessionists (Hagenbund). The Wiener Werkstaetten (Vienna's Workshops) attracted a lot of attention. Different from the paintings, German Arts and Crafts represented avant-garde movements. We will visit libraries, archives, and museums in St. Louis that have World's Fair holdings.

We will analyze the challenging politics and aesthetics of these confrontational films for what they tell us about Japan's modern history and cinema. The films provoke as well as entertain, providing trenchant (sometimes absurd) commentaries on postwar Japanese society and its transformations. Themes include: the legacy of WWII and Japanese imperialism; the student movement; juvenile delinquency; sexual liberation; and Tokyo subcultures. Directors include: Oshima Nagisa, Shinoda Masahiro, Terayama Shuji, Masumura Yasuzo, Suzuki Seijun, Matsumoto Toshio, and others. No knowledge of Japanese necessary. Credit 3 units.

The development of Bloomsbury was a rich cultural phenomenon recorded in autobiographies, journals, letters, essays, and memoirs as well as in fiction, and involving a fascinating group of personalities: Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Vanessa Bell, writers Lytton Strachey, E.M.

It registered four \"great revolutions\": Mexico 1910, Bolivia 1952, Cuba 1959, and Nicaragua 1979. These social revolutions entailed a substantial, violent, and voluntarist struggle for political power and the overthrow of the established political, economic, social, and cultural orders. In the wake of these successful revolutions, new revolutionary institutions of governance were founded, radical structural changes were implemented, and a new revolutionary ethos was adopted. With the exception perhaps of the Bolivian Revolution, these revolutions had a profound impact on Latin American and world politics. The primary aim of this course is to analyze and compare the causes, processes, and outcomes of the Mexican, Cuban, and Nicaraguan revolutions.",

Women played roles as filial daughters, dutiful wives, and devoted mothers, but also as proud courtesans, clever entrepreneurs, educated scholars and teachers, independent nuns, fierce warriors and even powerful rulers.  In this course we will begin with a broad overview of the ideal traditional roles for women established in early China. We will then move on to a general exploration of some of the ways women were represented in classical literature by male writers. Our main focus, however, will be on how, over time, more and more women took up the brush and began to write themselves. In so doing they were able to express their own subjectivity and often radically reinscribe many of the notions of femininity and of female roles that were dominant during their times.  We will conclude with a discussion of ways in which traditional women writers both anticipated and contributed to the 20th century transition to modernity. Most of our class discussion will be based on primary sources in English translation, supplemented by occasional secondary critical scholarly articles where relevant.

Students will be introduced to philosophical, ethical and political issues related to the existence of \"structural\" violence and to the problems connected to the symbolic representation of this phenomenon in literature, fictional/ documentary films, and visual arts. One of the course's objectives will be to problematize the conceptualization of violence and to promote critical thinking about its emergence, significance and effects on local/global societies. Some of the topics to be analyzed are the body in its multiple manifestations (the body politic, the social body, the individual body, the treatment of the corpse, etc.), the narrativization of violence (violence as discourse, documentation and fictional elaborations, violence and the media, violence and ideology, etc.), violence and the city, citizenry and otherness, bio-politics, etc. Finally, violence will be presented in different contexts and associated to different activities (ordinary crime, narco-cultures, maras, political movements, domestic environments) and different situations (e.g. violence in rural areas, violence in the borderlands, violence and migration). In all cases the course will call for a reflection on the interrelations between private/public spheres, gender politics, ideological/aesthetic values, and individual/ institutional levels.  The role of memory and emotions will be emphasized as a crucial element for the construction /mobilization of subjectivity and for the elaboration of agendas that challenge the State's monopoly of legitimate violence and propose alternative and often perverse forms of association and mobilization at the margins of institutional configurations.",

        "description": "The Great War of 1914-1918 is one of the most momentous events in history.  We can approach its broad European import by reading its literatures comparatively.  Far wider than the concerns of any one national ideology, the literature of record represents a profound crisis in the European cultural imaginary. A number of critical and interpretive issues will be in play in our readings, which will move through three major phases.  We begin with the powerful immediacy of trench poetry (1914-1919), develop into the constructed narratives of the great postwar novels and memoirs (1920-1931), and then turn toward the retrospect of the 1930s, which is also the prospect on the next, now inevitable, war.  The authors featured include combatant and civilian writers, names well-known and not so famous: Mann, Apollinaire, Owen, Pound, Cocteau, H.D., Woolf, Maurois, West, Celine, Joyce, Musil, Eliot, Rosenberg, Sassoon, Graves, Hardy, Trakl, Stramm, Lichtenstein, P\u00e9guy, Barbusse, Manning, J\u00fcnger, Zweig, Brittain, and Kroner.

        "description": "Societies are typically divided into classes. The upper-class of society tends to be composed of those individuals who enjoy high degrees of wealth and influence and have many opportunities open to them. The middle-class commands relatively less wealth and influence and has far fewer opportunities than the upper class, but nevertheless still enjoy a comfortable situation in society. The lower-class, by contrast, has far less wealth and influence and far fewer opportunities than other classes. In some societies, this division between classes is institutionalized (e.g. caste systems). However, in many societies it arises as something of a by-product of a society's political and economic policies (e.g. capitalism). But in both cases, the division of societies into social classes inevitably leads to conflicts - or struggles - between the competing classes over jobs, resources, services, legal rights, and especially political power. Such struggles sometimes lead to an improvement of the situation of members of the middle-class and lower class.  Other times, they merely lead to a furthering of the divisions between classes.  This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to the notion of class struggle, examining it from sociological, historical, political, and ethical perspectives. We will grapple with the fact that most \"victories\" in class struggles are temporary, that the division of societies into classes is often viewed as a \"fact of life,\" and that individuals tend to incorporate their class membership into their personal identities, taking for granted all the benefits and disadvantages that comes with said membership.",

In this course, we will engage with a broad range of readings that serve as primary texts in the 'history of sexuality and gender.'  Our aims are threefold: to analyze the literary evidence we have for sexuality and gender identity in Western culture, to survey modern scholarly approaches to those same texts and to consider the ways in which these modern theoretical frameworks have become the most recent set of 'primary' texts on sexuality and gender.",

The text itself is complex and layered, responding to its literary precursors, Enlightenment science, radical politics, aesthetic theory, feminism, Romantic idealism, Gothic horror, and more.  In order to understand these influences, we will examine texts read by Mary Shelley (and her characters), including letters, essays, poems, and scientific reports.  Our study of the novel's afterlives will begin with R. B. Peake's 1823 play, Presumption, which shaped much of the popular understanding of the Frankenstein myth during the 19th century.  Our investigation of 20th- and 21st-century manifestations of Frankenstein will focus on its appearance in film, racial discourse, scientific ethics, popular culture, and advertising. This portion of the course will include a viewing of the iconic 1931 Boris Karloff film, which established indelible versions of the mad scientist and his \"monster.\" Students in this seminar will be supported in developing individual final projects of their own design.

This course provides an introduction to those iconoclastic filmmakers, who went on to break with major studios and revolutionize oppositional filmmaking in Japan. We will analyze the challenging politics and aesthetics of these confrontational films for what they tell us about Japan's modern history and cinema. The films provoke as well as entertain, providing trenchant (sometimes absurd) commentaries on postwar Japanese society and its transformations. Themes include: the legacy of WWII and Japanese imperialism; the student movement; juvenile delinquency; sexual liberation; and Tokyo subcultures. Directors include: Oshima Nagisa, Shinoda Masahiro, Terayama Shuji, Masumura Yasuzo, Suzuki Seijun, Matsumoto Toshio, and others. No knowledge of Japanese necessary. Credit 3 units.

The world's largest secular democracy since independence in 1947, India has witnessed the rising ascendancy of the Hindu Right since the early 1990s.  In its wake, the Hindu Right has brought violence against minorities; curbs on free speech; and moves toward second-class citizenship for Indian Muslims. This course will track the history of the Hindu Right in India from its nineteenth century roots to the present. The struggle to come to grips with the Hindu Right is of immediate political relevance. And it raises big questions in the study of religion and secularism.",

In this course, we will explore a broad range of texts originating from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. They were written by both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews hailing from countries as diverse as Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy business woman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled.\nSpecifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an \"other,\" against which and through which they define a particular sense of self? To what extent are these texts reliable accounts of their authors' personal experiences, and where do they serve their own self-fashioning? How do the writers portray Christians, Muslims, and Jews from other cultural backgrounds than their own? How do they construe the role of women in a world dominated by men? How do they reflect on history, geography, and other fields of knowledge that were not covered by the traditional Jewish curriculum; and how do they respond to the challenges and opportunities of early modernity? \nThis course is open to students of varying interests, including Jewish, Islamic, or Religious Studies, medieval and early modern history, European or Near Eastern literatures. All texts will be read in English translation. ",

        "description": "This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore in some depth various facets of the convivencia (coexistence) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Iberia. We will pick up the timeline with the emergence of an Ibero-Islamic society in the 8th century CE; the seminar's historical horizon stretches up to the turn of the 16th century, when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of Spain and Portugal. Through a process termed, from a Christian perspective, as reconquista (Reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion, or migrated from one realm to the other. Interactions between the three ethno-religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by mutual respect and shared creativity and others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these religious and cultural encounters, placing them in various historical and geographic contexts. It will raise questions concerning the ambiguities of religious change, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. \nMethodologically, the seminar emphasizes the study of primary sources, including documentary, historiographical, literary and poetical texts. Structurally, the course divides into four main parts. Part 1 will cover the political and cultural history of Iberia from the 8th to the early 16th centuries; part 2 will be devoted to the Jewish experience under Muslim rule; and part 3 to the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Christian Spain. In part 4, we will discuss primary sources originating from each of the three communities that are portraying the respective Other. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. \nThis is the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic, & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors. Graduate students and advanced undergrads in other relevant fields are likewise welcome. ",

        "description": "Jewish literature includes a number of highly fascinating travel accounts and autobiographies that are still awaiting their discovery by a broader readership. In this course, we will explore a broad range of texts originating from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. They were written by both Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews hailing from countries as diverse as Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy business woman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled.\nSpecifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an \"other,\" against which and through which they define a particular sense of self? To what extent are these texts reliable accounts of their authors' personal experiences, and where do they serve their own self-fashioning? How do the writers portray Christians, Muslims, and Jews from other cultural backgrounds than their own? How do they construe the role of women in a world dominated by men? How do they reflect on history, geography, and other fields of knowledge that were not covered by the traditional Jewish curriculum; and how do they respond to the challenges and opportunities of early modernity? \nThis course is open to students of varying interests, including Jewish, Islamic, or Religious Studies, medieval and early modern history, European or Near Eastern literatures. All texts will be read in English translation. ",

During the 20th century Korea went through a radical process of modernization.  From its colonization by Japan, to its suffering of a civil war within the cold war order, to its growth into a cultural and economic powerhouse, Korea's historical experience is at once unique and typical of that of a third-world nation.  By immersing ourselves in the most distinctive literary voices from Korea, we examine how the Korean experience of modernization was filtered through its cultutral production.  In class discussion, we pay special attention to the writers' construction of the self and the nation.  How do social categories such as ethnicity, class, gender, and race figure in the varying images of the self?  And how do these images relate to the literary vision of the nation?  Along the way, we observe the prominent ideas, themes, and genres of Korean literature.  This class combines discussion with lecture with students strongly encouraged to participate.  All literary texts are in English translation and no previous knowledge of Korean is required.",

We will begin by examining a variety of theoretical perspectives, definitions and critiques of 'development'. We will highlight the uneven processes of development at multiple, overlapping scales and the power imbalances inherent in much of development discourse. In the second half of the course we will focus our considerations towards specific contemporary trends and development issues, utilizing case studies drawn primarily from Latin America. These themes will include sustainability, NGOs, social movements, social capital, security and conflict, identity, ethnicity and gender issues, participatory development, and micro-credit and conditional cash transfers. Students will acquire the critical theoretical tools to develop their own perspectives on how development geographies play out in Latin America.",

        "description": "The course will focus on the definitions, uses and \"languages\" of violence in Latin America, particularly during the last decades of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. Students will be introduced to philosophical, ethical and political issues related to the existence of \"structural\" violence and to the problems connected to the symbolic representation of this phenomenon in literature, fictional/ documentary films, and visual arts. One of the course's objectives will be to problematize the conceptualization of violence and to promote critical thinking about its emergence, significance and effects on local/global societies. Some of the topics to be analyzed are the body in its multiple manifestations (the body politic, the social body, the individual body, the treatment of the corpse, etc.), the narrativization of violence (violence as discourse, documentation and fictional elaborations, violence and the media, violence and ideology, etc.), violence and the city, citizenry and otherness, bio-politics, etc. Finally, violence will be presented in different contexts and associated to different activities (ordinary crime, narco-cultures, maras, political movements, domestic environments) and different situations (e.g. violence in rural areas, violence in the borderlands, violence and migration). In all cases the course will call for a reflection on the interrelations between private/public spheres, gender politics, ideological/aesthetic values, and individual/ institutional levels.  The role of memory and emotions will be emphasized as a crucial element for the construction /mobilization of subjectivity and for the elaboration of agendas that challenge the State's monopoly of legitimate violence and propose alternative and often perverse forms of association and mobilization at the margins of institutional configurations.",

Paradoxically, land tenure has been put forth as both the obstacle and the solution to the country's modernization. Given its centrality in the construction of the modern period, this course examines liberalism, agrarian revolts, the revolution, the green revolution and neoliberalism through the lens of land issues. This course will also explore how these have shaped and have been shaped by indigenous peoples and peasants, from land disentailment to the fight against GMO maize. Students will evaluate agrarian reforms, agricultural modernization programs, concepts of and transformations of natural resources, food production/consumption and social policies.

This course provides students with a concrete understanding of the practical difficulties arising from linguistic differences and helps them discover ways in which these difficulties can be addressed. In particular, students are expected to devote two hours per week tutoring local K-12 students and to keep a journal focusing on their experiences from a linguistic perspective. Students will be expected to attend weekly meetings with faculty and community partners to relate challenges that they have encountered and to discuss possible solutions. Students will also receive training on how to better understand and serve under-sourced and diverse populations.\nPrerequisite: At least two 300-level courses in Linguistics or permission of the instructors",

This is an urgent question at a historical moment when American society is becoming more diverse and more unequal. Through a sociological lens, this course explores key areas of inequality: social class and poverty, racism and sexism, the crisis in health care, and the perils of globalization. We examine empirical underpinnings of these areas focusing on the intersection of statuses related to race, social class, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality that heighten risk for social and political disadvantages. Our investigation capitalizes on rich sources of multidisciplinary data and methods. These sources offer a foundation for an original research project allowing students to gain an understanding of the complexity of social problems emanating from inequality, and productive intellectual and policy responses. Guests from agencies dealing directly with these issues will share perspectives. Students will emerge from the course with critical skills that empower them to decipher contemporary policy debates and develop their own critical analyses.",

However, it is not only lawyers who need to be able to incorporate the law into their professional practice: in this course, we will look at the many different types of writing in and about the law to see how the principles of rhetoric must be used to persuade in different ways depending on the writer's purpose. We will learn the skills necessary to adapt the framing of our writing to its audience as we think about how we might persuade a judge, a lay client, a community, a committee or other professionals. We will consider the psychological effects of our writing and how we seek to persuade our readers not only with the strength of our reasoning but with the power of our emotional appeal to their particular interests. We will learn how to think and write about the law in a range of circumstances as assignments cover writing for business about implications of laws, reporting about a law for the popular press, investigating a legal issue and explaining a law's ramifications as well as attempting to encourage support for a particular law; this is not, however, a technical legal writing course. Readings will be drawn from statutes and judgments but more commonly from academic, business and popular examples of writing on the interpretation of laws governing topical concerns. Issues to be dealt with may include the extent of police/citizens' rights to protect themselves (so-called Stand Your Ground laws); rights to refuse medical treatment (Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dept of Health); religious groups' rights to discriminate (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act); Open Carry laws (St. Louis Zoo v Smith); immigration proposals such as The Dream Act; reform of mandatory prison sentences.",

When the state or a community wants its citizens or members to be \"good,\" it crafts laws and creates customs to encourage or inhibit behaviors.  This class examines how state and non-state actors have attempted to regulate the lived experiences of Americans and the conflicts that emerge over what, exactly, is correct, or right, or good for individuals, society, and the state.

        "description": "Thousands of lawsuits are filed daily in the state and federal courts of the United States. The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes and analytical constructs for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, the enforceability of presidential travel bans; contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police. Sophomore standing is strongly recommended for enrollment in this course. Attendance mandatory during the first week of classes.",

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (or women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women. Over the years, this course has attracted WGSS students and pre-law students. This course is taught by law students under the supervision of a member of the School of Law faculty..

We will study seminal works in the history of political economy (Smith, Malthus, Marx, Keynes, Krugman, etc.) and explore the social, economic, and political histories in which they were grounded. We will begin with the Industrial Revolution in Britain, the works of Adam Smith, and the emergence of political economy as a field of inquiry. We will end with the globalization of the 1970s, the works of Joseph Stiglitz, and the challenges that a more interconnected world has posed for both the organization of the economy and the practice of economics as a discipline.

In addition to the central concepts and theories in each area, the course will address philosophical implications of this research concerning how the mind and brain are related, how the mind-brain encodes or represents information, and the nature of consciousness. And there will be an emphasis on applying these findings to important problems, such as Alzheimer's disease and deficits due to brain damage. The class is taught by three members of the faculty from different disciplines and combines a whole-group lecture with small discussion classes.  The goal is to give students a good understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science and to help them develop the ability to think and write critically about scientific research into the mind-brain.

The texts in this course are essays, journalism, and personal narratives describing the experience of patients and physicians in the modern American health care system, including classic pieces by Sontag, Sacks, and Ehrenreich, and more recent writings by Gawande, Hemon, Ofri, Chen, Jamison, Groopman, and Mukherjee. We will analyze the form, diction, argumentative strategies, and figurative language in these texts, with the aim of learning some of the techniques that make for persuasive prose. In addition to allowing students to think critically and personally about their own experiences being ill and receiving medical treatment, the assignments will give students the opportunity to develop their own skills in communicating effectively in writing. Peer review sessions will encourage substantive revision.",

We will read a variety of academic literature and use media texts and listening examples to develop interdisciplinary and cross-cultural analyses of music and healing.  Issues of national consciousness, post/colonialism, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, religion, dis/ability and the role of history/memory will remain central to our explorations of music and healing.",

Additionally, Jewish political thought can be found through a Jewish community's self-understanding based on its interpretation of Jewish text and law by which it bound itself.   Because we span over 2,000 years of recorded history, we will not attempt to discern a single \"Jewish political thought\" but rather look at JPT through the lens of familiar concepts of political theory.  The fundamental questions we will explore are the relationship of the Jewish tradition to concepts such as authority, law, consent, sovereignty, and justice.  We will ask how the Jewish tradition views government and the relationship between the authority of God and the authority of temporal powers.  We will explore these questions through a range of materials that include both primary and secondary literature.",

But are love and reason really so distinct?  What does it mean to say so, and why might someone make this claim?  Can love be reasoned, and even reasonable?  Can reason be aided by love, and even driven by it?  How might different answers to these questions affect our understanding of other possibly unreasoned categories like faith, belief, and piety?

The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes and analytical constructs for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, the enforceability of presidential travel bans; contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police.

        "description": "We tend to associate certain ideas with \"science\".  Science is \"objective,\" it involves empirical investigations of the natural world, specific methods, the development of theories, or more precisely, the identification of laws of nature.  But, one could press these common sense generalizations a bit more:  What does it mean to say science is objective\" - are scientists objective, and what does that mean, exactly?  Are the methods of science objective, and exactly what does that mean?  Can objectivity come by degrees?  Is there a \"hard and fast\" distinction between science and non-science, or perhaps pseudo-science?  What really makes something \"science\"?  This course is an introduction to exactly these questions.  We will read texts in the history and philosophy of science. The philosophy of science is an exploration of the methods and aims of scientific inquiry.  Philosophers of science have increasingly stressed the importance of close examination of episodes in the history of science in order to ground their explorations. So, a good part of the course will involve critical examination of  concrete examples from different periods in the history of scientific ideas, and different scientific disciplines. Readings in history of science will vary by semester, but we will likely focus two periods: the \"Scientific Revolution\" (late 1500s to 1700) and the \"Darwinian revolution\" (1859-1930 or so).

        "description": "We tend to associate certain ideas with \"science\".  Science is \"objective,\" it involves empirical investigations of the natural world, specific methods, the development of theories, or more precisely, the identification of laws of nature.  But, one could press these common sense generalizations a bit more:  What does it mean to say science is objective\" - are scientists objective, and what does that mean, exactly?  Are the methods of science objective, and exactly what does that mean?  Can objectivity come by degrees?  Is there a \"hard and fast\" distinction between science and non-science, or perhaps pseudo-science?  What really makes something \"science\"?  This course is an introduction to exactly these questions.  We will read texts in the history and philosophy of science. The philosophy of science is an exploration of the methods and aims of scientific inquiry.  Philosophers of science have increasingly stressed the importance of close examination of episodes in the history of science in order to ground their explorations. So, a good part of the course will involve critical examination of  concrete examples from different periods in the history of scientific ideas, and different scientific disciplines. Readings in history of science will vary by semester, but we will likely focus two periods: the \"Scientific Revolution\" (late 1500s to 1700) and the \"Darwinian revolution\" (1859-1930 or so). Prerequisites: one course in Philosophy at the 100 or 200-level, or permission of the instructor.  Priority given to majors in Philosophy & PNP.",

We explore basic concepts in pragmatics (e.g., speech acts, politeness, face, conversational implicature) and discuss issues such as cross-cultural differences in pragmatic language use and in native speaker and learner perceptions of language use. In doing so, we address both theoretical and instructional implications of research in L2 pragmatics.

While this tradition includes writing from and about the three historical periods of Jewish self-rule (including the modern state of Israel), most of the Jewish political tradition comes from the understand of politics as viewed from outsiders to mainstream communities.  Additionally, Jewish political thought can be found through a Jewish community's self-understanding based on its interpretation of Jewish text and law by which it bound itself.   Because we span over 2,000 years of recorded history, we will not attempt to discern a single \"Jewish political thought\" but rather look at JPT through the lens of familiar concepts of political theory.  The fundamental questions we will explore are the relationship of the Jewish tradition to concepts such as authority, law, consent, sovereignty, and justice.  We will ask how the Jewish tradition views government and the relationship between the authority of God and the authority of temporal powers.  We will explore these questions through a range of materials that include both primary and secondary literature.",

The disputes underlying those lawsuits are as messy and complex as the human, commercial, cultural and political dynamics that trigger them, and the legal processes and analytical constructs for resolving those disputes are expensive, time-consuming and, for most citizens, seemingly impenetrable. At the same time law and legal conflict permeate public discourse in the United States to a degree that is unique in the world, even among the community of long-established democracies. The overarching objective of the course is to prepare our undergraduate students to participate constructively in that discourse by providing them with a conceptual framework for understanding both the conduct and resolution of legal conflict by American legal institutions, and the evolution of - - and values underlying - - the substantive law American courts apply to those conflicts. This is, at core, a course in the kind of legal or litigation \"literacy\" that should be expected of the graduates of first-tier American universities. Some of the legal controversies that will be used to help develop that \"literacy\" include those surrounding the permissible use of lethal force in self-defense, the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions, the enforceability of presidential travel bans; contracts that are unconscionably one-sided, sexual harassment in the workplace, the duty of landlords to prevent criminal assaults on their tenants, groundwater pollution alleged to cause pediatric cancers, and warrantless searches of cellphone locator data by police.

There are three main goals of this course: to teach students to read, understand and criticize quantitative analysis in published and unpublished work, to provide them with the skills necessary to begin conducting their own analyses, and to lay the foundations for quantitative methods. We will cover the fundamentals of how political scientists are able to draw causal inferences. To do so, we will review basic probability and statistics. We will then discuss the types of inferences possible with different data-generating processes, including laboratory experiments, randomized field experiments, and observational data. There are no prerequisites for this class beyond approaching the material with an open and curious mind. Much of the material in this course is technical and a successful student in this course will spend a significant amount of time outside of class working through problem sets and becoming familiar with the necessary statistical software.",

This motivation is accomplished by means of a consistent focus on such processes as individual decision making, the representation of issues, statistical phenomena, and phenomena of change over time.  The course assumes a sufficient background in elementary algebra, logic, functions, and graphs; remedial work in these areas will be offered through a review course during the last week or two of summer.

        "description": "Territorial conflicts are among the most contentious and difficult to resolve in international politics. Territorial conflict is also found to be one of the most frequent causes of intrastate violence and civil war onset. At a theoretical level, territory is central to almost any aspect of international relations, as it is what physically defines states, where any kind of violent conflict takes place, and influences the character of violent conflict in important ways. A large empirical literature convincingly shows that territory is a key determinant of international conflict. However, much remains unexplored both theoretically and empirically. \n\nIn this course, we explore the role that territory plays in a wide variety of contexts. We motivate the course by noting that although territory has been shown to be empirically central to the majority of violent disputes, explanations for why this is the case lag behind the evidence. Subsequently, we study the role territory plays in state-making, international conflict, the settlement of disputes, international trade, international investment, the effectiveness of treaties, ethnic identity, and civil wars, among others. Week by week we pay particular attention to the central theoretical role territory plays in international relations. We will put particular emphasis on thinking about how territory relates to bargaining models of conflict.",

Altnough the field of social cognition initialy had a strong focus on cognitive processes, students should keep in mind that the term, as currently employed, fully embraces emotion, both as it relates to memory as well as attitudes. Indeed, a guiding principle of this course is that much of social behavior can be understood as an bidirectional interplay between memory, emotion, and attitudes.  For example, retrieving a memory of a threatening event can automatically trigger different types of correlated but distinct negative emotions. These distinct affective states can, in, turn, exert different types of effects on different types of social attitudes.  Also, the types of memories that are retrieved--and the ways that those memories are processed--can moderate the ways that emotion and attitudes are ultimately influenced. Readings will draw primarily from classic and contemporary work in social and cognitive psychology, although we will also be considering implications for other relevant areas, such as clincal and political psychology.

And what does it mean to study religion, given the slipperiness of the concept itself?\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the academic study of religion through a consideration of these questions: What is religion, and how can we study it? Do we need an answer to the first question to pursue the second? Why, and toward what ends, might we undertake such study? We will also consider what is at stake in our investigation and inquiry into religion-for the inquirers, for the subjects of inquiry, and for society more broadly-and what kind of lens the study of religion offers us on ourselves, our neighbors, and society, in turn. To these ends, we will discuss major theoretical approaches to the study of religion and significant work on religions and religious phenomena, toward a better understanding of what \"religion\" might be and how it might be studied today.

        "description": "What did Jesus of Nazareth and his early followers teach about sexuality-about marriage, adultery, divorce, the virtues of procreation and celibacy, same-sex relationships, and erotic desire? How and why did ancient Christians take different stances on these issues, and how do these traditions continue to inform sexual ethics and gender roles today? In this class, we will study these questions by examining key passages from the teachings of Jesus in the Gospels, Paul's letters, writings of early church leaders, martyr propaganda, monastic literature, and apocryphal books deemed heretical. We will also consider the interpretations of contemporary historians of religion informed by recent trends in sexuality and gender theories.",

You will: 1) acquire knowledge of the disparate religions practiced in North America during the twentieth century and beyond; 2) examine some of the chief conflicts as well as alliances between religion and the American social order in a global context; and 3) develop interpretive tools for understanding religion\u00b4s present and enduring role in the US and the world.",

Additionally, Jewish political thought can be found through a Jewish community's self-understanding based on its interpretation of Jewish text and law by which it bound itself.   Because we span over 2,000 years of recorded history, we will not attempt to discern a single \"Jewish political thought\" but rather look at JPT through the lens of familiar concepts of political theory.  The fundamental questions we will explore are the relationship of the Jewish tradition to concepts such as authority, law, consent, sovereignty, and justice.  We will ask how the Jewish tradition views government and the relationship between the authority of God and the authority of temporal powers.  We will explore these questions through a range of materials that include both primary and secondary literature.",

But are love and reason really so distinct?  What does it mean to say so, and why might someone make this claim?  Can love be reasoned, and even reasonable?  Can reason be aided by love, and even driven by it?  How might different answers to these questions affect our understanding of other possibly unreasoned categories like faith, belief, and piety?

First, we examine the Puritan sermon that politicians quote when they describe America as a \"city on a hill.\"  This sermon has been called the \"ur-text\" of American literature, the foundational document of American culture.  Learning and drawing from multiple literary methodologies, we will re-investigate what that sermon means and how it came to tell a story about the Puritan origins of American culture -- a thesis our class will reassess with the help of modern critics.  In the second part of this class, we broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years.  Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day.  Our last days will be spent discussing the rhetoric and legacy of American exceptionalism in the speeches of Obama and Trump.  In the end, students will gain a firm grasp of the long history and continuing significance of this concept in American culture.\n ",

In particular, we will pay attention to the issue of ritual and how Confucians attempted to ritualize social interactions and the world at large. In order to do so, we will engage in the writings of Confucius, Mengzi, and Xunzi, three early Chinese writers whose basic ideas about ritual heavily informed myriad cultural practices that are formative for large portions of East Asia today. Hence, this course on ancient thinkers not only introduces thoughts and practices prevalent throughout pre-modern China, Japan, and Korea. It also functions as a catalyst that helps us understand some of the reasons and motivations behind these communities' recent efforts to renegotiate and question \"the colonialist flavor\" of human rights and democracy.",

When the state or a community wants its citizens or members to be \"good,\" it crafts laws and creates customs to encourage or inhibit behaviors.  This class examines how state and non-state actors have attempted to regulate the lived experiences of Americans and the conflicts that emerge over what, exactly, is correct, or right, or good for individuals, society, and the state.

Among the authors were pilgrims, rabbis, merchants, and one savvy business woman. We will read their works as responses to historical circumstances and as expressions of Jewish identity, in its changing relationship to the Christian or Muslim environment in which the writers lived or traveled.\nSpecifically, we will ask questions such as: How do travel accounts and autobiographies enable their authors and readers to reflect on issues of identity and difference? How do the writers produce representations of an \"other,\" against which and through which they define a particular sense of self? To what extent are these texts reliable accounts of their authors' personal experiences, and where do they serve their own self-fashioning? How do the writers portray Christians, Muslims, and Jews from other cultural backgrounds than their own? How do they construe the role of women in a world dominated by men? How do they reflect on history, geography, and other fields of knowledge that were not covered by the traditional Jewish curriculum; and how do they respond to the challenges and opportunities of early modernity? \nThis course is open to students of varying interests, including Jewish, Islamic, or Religious Studies, medieval and early modern history, European or Near Eastern literatures.

We take a critical perspective on narratives that attribute violence in the Middle East to a timeless \"clash of civilizations\" and ask: How have wars by Western countries in the Middle East transformed the culture and politics of the region? How do contemporary wars against \"terror\" reproduce the assumptions of civilizational difference that drove earlier colonial wars? What makes deaths of Arabs/Muslims at the hands of war largely unrecognized? And how do assumptions about Middle Eastern patriarchy and homophobia justify and even incite wars in the name of humanity? Sophomore standing required.",

As time passed, and Jesus' movement grew into a world religion-Christianity-disagreement among Christians only continued to increase, leading to the need to define and enforce correct beliefs and practices-a Christian 'orthodoxy' embodied in the now-familiar institutions of creed, canon, and clergy. Yet in the process of creating an orthodoxy, what was left out? Whose voices were suppressed? Through careful study of ancient texts long-ago deemed heretical, and virtually lost until the twentieth century, this course examines the wide varieties of Christianity in its nascent years, and how the framers of orthodoxy defined themselves against these alternatives.",

        "description": "This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore in some depth various facets of the convivencia (coexistence) of Muslims, Jews, and Christians in medieval Iberia. We will pick up the timeline with the emergence of an Ibero-Islamic society in the 8th century CE; the seminar's historical horizon stretches up to the turn of the 16th century, when Spanish Jews and Muslims were equally faced with the choice between exile and conversion to Christianity. Until about 1100, Muslims dominated most of the Iberian Peninsula; from then onward, Christians ruled much and eventually all of Spain and Portugal. Through a process termed, from a Christian perspective, as reconquista (Reconquest), Catholic kingdoms acquired large Muslim enclaves. As borders moved, Jewish communities found themselves under varying Muslim or Christian dominion, or migrated from one realm to the other. Interactions between the three ethno-religious communities occurred throughout, some characterized by mutual respect and shared creativity and others by rivalry and strife. The course focuses on these religious and cultural encounters, placing them in various historical and geographic contexts. It will raise questions concerning the ambiguities of religious change, and the interplay of persecution and toleration. \nMethodologically, the seminar emphasizes the study of primary sources, including documentary, historiographical, literary and poetical texts. Structurally, the course divides into four main parts. Part 1 will cover the political and cultural history of Iberia from the 8th to the early 16th centuries; part 2 will be devoted to the Jewish experience under Muslim rule; and part 3 to the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Christian Spain. In part 4, we will discuss primary sources originating from each of the three communities that are portraying the respective Other. All sources will be read in English translation; however, students are encouraged to make use of their linguistic and cultural expertise acquired in previous classes. \nThis is the capstone seminar for Jewish, Islamic, & Near Eastern Studies majors, Arabic majors, and Hebrew majors. Graduate students and advanced undergrads in other relevant fields are likewise welcome. ",

This course considers the role of religious thought and practice in such movements in the twentieth century. The history of these movements presents an apparent paradox: how can political action emerge from the supposedly \"private\" realm of religion in the modern era, particularly its most individualistic formations in contemplative and mystical practices? Does the historical role of these practices in the political sphere complicate their portrayal in some scholarship as private, individual, and depoliticizing? With these questions animating our investigations, we will consider the work of authors and activists including Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Luther King, Jr., Simone Weil, and William Barber, as well as the history of movements associated with their work. Toward the end of the semester, we will turn to contemporary movements against economic inequality, intimate violence, racially motivated violence, and discrimination toward transgender persons to discuss the use of religious strategies or religiously-derived strategies in current political and social activism.",

Despite the distinct genres, time periods, and topics, one important aspect will regularly appear: apparently people perceived the boundaries between the living and the dead to be quite porous in pre-modern China.

And what does it mean to study religion, given the slipperiness of the concept itself?\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the academic study of religion through a consideration of these questions: What is religion, and how can we study it? Do we need an answer to the first question to pursue the second? Why, and toward what ends, might we undertake such study? We will also consider what is at stake in our investigation and inquiry into religion-for the inquirers, for the subjects of inquiry, and for society more broadly-and what kind of lens the study of religion offers us on ourselves, our neighbors, and society, in turn. To these ends, we will discuss major theoretical approaches to the study of religion and significant work on religions and religious phenomena, toward a better understanding of what \"religion\" might be and how it might be studied today.

Additionally, Jewish political thought can be found through a Jewish community's self-understanding based on its interpretation of Jewish text and law by which it bound itself.   Because we span over 2,000 years of recorded history, we will not attempt to discern a single \"Jewish political thought\" but rather look at JPT through the lens of familiar concepts of political theory.  The fundamental questions we will explore are the relationship of the Jewish tradition to concepts such as authority, law, consent, sovereignty, and justice.  We will ask how the Jewish tradition views government and the relationship between the authority of God and the authority of temporal powers.

Learning and drawing from multiple literary methodologies, we will re-investigate what that sermon means and how it came to tell a story about the Puritan origins of American culture -- a thesis our class will reassess with the help of modern critics.  In the second part of this class, we broaden our discussion to consider the wider (and newer) meanings of American exceptionalism, theorizing the concept while looking at the way it has been revitalized, redefined and redeployed in recent years.  Finally, the course ends with a careful study of American exceptionalism in modern political rhetoric, starting with JFK and proceeding through Reagan to the current day.  Our last days will be spent discussing the rhetoric and legacy of American exceptionalism in the speeches of Obama and Trump.  In the end, students will gain a firm grasp of the long history and continuing significance of this concept in American culture.\n ",

We will pay particular attention to how bodies were a venue for encounter-through sexual contact, through the policing of gendered social and economic behaviors, and through religiously-based understandings of women's and men's duties and functions. We will also study how historians know what they know about these encounters, and what materials enable them to answer their historical questions.",

Buckley, Frank Meyer, Pat Buchanan, Phyllis Schafly, Jerry Falwell, Ronald Reagan, the neocons, and ending with some of the younger conservative pundits of today like Rich Lowery, Mark Steyn, Ann Coulter, Michelle Malkin, and Dinesh D'Souza.  We will also look at the career of Sarah Palin and the rise of the Tea Party.  Several classes are devoted to black conservatives including Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele, and Clarence Thomas.  We will conclude the course with a consideration of the impact of Donald Trump on the Republican Party and conservatism generally.  We try to answer the questions: What is conservatism and who are its adherents?  Can we speak of conservatism in the singular or are there several types of conservatism?  Are the various forms of conservatism politically and intellectually compatible?  How has conservatism changed since Reagan and the 1980s?  What inroads has conservatism made in the cultural and political life of the United States?  Is the United States essentially a conservative nation?  Attendance mandatory.",

        "description": "Although political action is often considered a problem of making oneself heard, religious practices of silence, self-effacement, and withdrawal from certain worldly struggles have guided many significant political and social movements, particularly forms of non-violent resistance. This course considers the role of religious thought and practice in such movements in the twentieth century. The history of these movements presents an apparent paradox: how can political action emerge from the supposedly \"private\" realm of religion in the modern era, particularly its most individualistic formations in contemplative and mystical practices? Does the historical role of these practices in the political sphere complicate their portrayal in some scholarship as private, individual, and depoliticizing? With these questions animating our investigations, we will consider the work of authors and activists including Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Luther King, Jr., Simone Weil, and William Barber, as well as the history of movements associated with their work. Toward the end of the semester, we will turn to contemporary movements against economic inequality, intimate violence, racially motivated violence, and discrimination toward transgender persons to discuss the use of religious strategies or religiously-derived strategies in current political and social activism.",

In this course we will compare historical (1880-1920) and contemporary (1965-present) waves of immigration to the United States. We will explore why and how people migrate, immigrant integration, the impact of immigration on native-born Americans, and how government policies-at the national, state, and local level-shape immigrant assimilation and what it means to be considered truly \"American,\" in a social as well as a legal sense.

We will pay special attention to themes like writing as a legitimizing force, reading & nation building, and the intersection of print with war, debates on race, identity formation, and economic modernization. The importance of reading practices as a form of sociability and the intersections between popular and elite cultures will also feature as interpretative frameworks for many of the seminar's readings. These span from independence war poetry to pillars of GAUCHESQUE writing, from mythic novels like MAR\u00cdA to the debunking of myths in plays by Florencio S\u00e1nchez, from accounts of slave experiences to flighty MODERNISTA  fancies. Historical and theoretical selections will guide our analysis of primary sources.",

This will be our point of departure to better understand the uses of the past, as it becomes part of a text, and goes through the unavoidable process of fictionalization. We will study, for example, the ever problematic relations between the nobility and the monarchy and the uses of History as a source of exemplary matter, as inspiration to help create and reinforce social identity, and as a way to overcome censorship. With the objective of acquiring a better understanding of the uses of the past as a strategy to comment, explain and try to modify the present moment, and given the popularity that the historical novel has acquired in Spain in recent years, especially after the transition to democracy, our reading list will also include a few examples of these types of texts. For their final projects, the students will be asked to work in a synchronic and comparative way, with various representations of a legend, a character, or a historical event of their choice.

The major purpose of the course is to gradually reveal how a city operates internally, and how it operates externally with its sister cities, surrounding metropolitan areas and neighboring states, amidst competing and often contradictory interests.  Utilizing historical analysis as a guide, the course will briefly revisit the experiences of previous waves of ethnic groups to the St. Louis metropolitan area, as a lens for understanding the current social, political and economic dilemmas which many urban dwellers in St. Louis now face. The course will reveal to students the intricacies of social welfare issues and policies among high density populations, in St. Louis, that are homogeneous and heterogeneous, at the same time.  Visits and discussions with various governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and how such agencies function or dysfunction for various constituencies allow students to ask crucial questions regarding equality of opportunity in a democratic society.  Students will also encounter diverse communities and neighborhoods and the intended and unintended consequences of social welfare policies designed to ameliorate urban dilemmas such as poverty and inequality, homelessness, educational underachievement, gentrification, migration and immigration, development, health care, fiscal issues, the informal economy, and issues concerned with crime and social justice, among others.  Readings are reinforced and challenged through visits, interactions and observations with broad constituencies and institutions, ranging from city officials to community residents.  As such, this course offers a survey discussion of the rich interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies for those who may be interested in pursuing a stand alone major in the field of Urban Studies.",

It further surveys the demographic and spatial transformation of American cities examining the consequences of urban transformation on federal, state and local politics, on society and on her institutions. Similarly, the course focuses on the origin and societal changes and emerging goals of urban development, gentrification and evolving patterns of metropolitanism and the necessity for central city as well as neighborhood reconstruction. The dynamics of racial residential segregation, crime and punishment, issues of academic achievement and under-achievement, the social cleavages of urban marginalized communities, family structure, urban homelessness, urban sprawl, and health care, among others, are viewed from the perspective of social justice by exploring social, political, economic, racial, and ethnic factors that impact on access, equity and care. Various theoretical perspectives and philosophies are introduced that have dominated the discourse on race and urban poverty.

During the last eight weeks, we deliver these workshops once a week to students at Compton-Drew Middle School (adjacent to the Science Center in the city of St. Louis). \nIn this course we celebrate the choices of studies we each pursue, and expand our experience by learning from each other's knowledge bases and creativity.  The course is offered each Fall and Spring semester, and is open to students from all disciplines, schools, freshmen through seniors, and meets the multidisciplinary Fieldwork requirement for AMCS majors.American Culture Studies (AMCS) is a multidisciplinary program that provides both a broader context for study in different fields and a deeper understanding of American culture in all of its complexities\n**Attendance Mandatory for all the classes.**\n\nTo meet compliance with University Policies on Minors, all students participating in this class will be required to undergo a fingerprinting background check, which is done on campus, prior to interacting with the Compton-Drew students. This carries a $50 Lab/materials fee to cover the cost of this check.",

Second, the course emphasizes the skills related to the exercise of policy analysis. These skills include the crafting of technical documents within the field of public policy (e.g. a policy brief) and the application of scientific methods to the exploration of social problems/governmental actions. Likely issues related to this course feature include the use of scientific knowledge in political arenas, engagement with stakeholders and the intended/unintended consequences of policy science to political decision-making. Third, this course simulates the policymaking context through students' participation in mock congressional testimonies. These focal areas will become central to an understanding of four social concerns: school desegregation following the Brown decisions; affirmative action in higher education; Head Start programs and/or the ESEA Act of 1965, also known as No Child Left Behind.

Between these two landmark characters lie the two and a half centuries of rich and diverse fiction for girls that will be at the center of this writing-intensive course. After grounding our studies by reading selected works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, we will concentrate on twentieth-century productions, beginning with the surprisingly progressive serial fiction produced by the Stratemeyer Syndicate and others in the early 1900s. (Titles such as The Motor Girls, The Moving Picture Girls, and The Outdoor Girls advertise the series\u00b4 departure from domestic settings.) Throughout our study of both popular and classic texts, we will investigate the social, political and familial roles for girls that the texts imagine. Major genres will include mysteries, frontier fiction, career fiction, domestic fiction, school stories, and fantasy. Authors will include Newbery, Alcott, Montgomery, Wilder, Lindgren, and \"Carolyn Keene.\"  Writing Intensive. Satisfies the Twentieth Century and later requirement.",

In this course, we participate in this national project of history-making by helping to excavate the queer past in the greater St. Louis region. Course readings will focus on the ways that sexual identities and communities in the United States have been shaped by urban settings since the late nineteenth century, with particular attention to the ways that race, class and gender have structured queer spaces and communities. In their community service project, students will work with the grassroots St. Louis LGBT History Project to research St. Louis's queer past, including conducting oral histories with local LGBTQ elders. IMPORTANT NOTE:  This is a service-learning class, which means it combines classroom learning with outside work at a community organization.   In addition to regular class time, there is a service requirement, which will necessitate an additional 3-4 hours a week. Before beginning community service students must complete required training.

However, long before 1969, U.S. writers such as James Baldwin, Gertrude Stein, Langston Hughes, Willa Cather, and Walt Whitman depicted queer sexuality in their work. In this course, through our readings of fiction, poetry, and drama, we will survey queer literary production before the liberatory moment of Stonewall. During the semester, we will also screen several films, such as the award-winning Capote and the experimental documentary Looking for Langston. Throughout, we will consider a number of questions. What, if anything, is unique about queerness in America? How do American writers represent nonnormative sexualities, in either explicit or coded ways? In what ways did the pre-Stonewall U.S. enable lesbian and gay sexualities, and in what ways did it render those identities unsustainable? How do racial, class, and gender identities intersect with sexual identities? What is queer about the literary forms and styles these writers deployed?

In this course, we will explore the sexual politics of film noir as a distinctive vision of American sexual relations every bit as identifiable as the form's stylized lighting and circuitous storytelling.  We will explore how and why sexual paranoia and perversion seem to animate this genre and why these movies continue to influence \"neo-noir\" filmmaking into the 21st century, even as film noir's representation of gender and sexuality is inseparable from its literary antecedents, most notably, the so-called \"hard-boiled\" school of writing.  We will read examples from this literature by Dashiell Hammett, James Cain, Raymond Chandler and Cornell Woolrich, and discuss these novels and short stories in the context of other artistic and cultural influences on gendered power relations and film noir.  We will also explore the relationship of these films to censorship and to changing post-World War II cultural values.  Films to be screened in complete prints or in excerpts will likely include many of the following: The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Murder My Sweet, Phantom Lady, Strangers on a Train, The Big Sleep, The Killers, Mildred Pierce, The High Wall, Sudden Fear, The Big Combo, Laura, The Glass Key, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, The Crimson Kimono, Touch of Evil, Alphaville, Chinatown, Taxi Driver, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Bad Lieutenant, and Memento.

We will begin by placing our current legal framework, and its gender, race, sexuality, and other societal assumptions, in an historical and Constitutional context.  We will then examine many of the questions raised by feminist theory, feminist jurisprudence, and other critical perspectives.  For example, is the legal subject gendered male, and, if so, how can advocates (or women and men) use the law to gain greater equality?  What paradoxes have emerged in areas such as employment discrimination, family law, or reproductive rights, as women and others have sought liberal equality?  What is the equality/difference debate about and why is it important for feminists?  How do intersectionality and various schools of feminist thought affect our concepts of discrimination, equality, and justice? The course is thematic, but we will spend time on key cases that have influenced law and policy, examining how they affect the everyday lives of women.

This course is not interested in defining what pleasure is, but it interrogates what the stakes of talking about pleasure have been within contemporary theory and culture.  Beginning with an examination of pleasure in the context of early twentieth century sexology, this course looks at the sex wars of the 1970s, the turn toward pleasure as a space of protest, and ends by thinking of ways to imagine pleasure outside of current paradigms of sexuality.

Research is employed in a variety of ways in the different disciplines within the academy and within different practices outside of the academy. This course examines the different ways in which research is conducted and examines the reasons for these differences and the ways in which they contribute to or hamper feminist goals. The course also explores the ways in which some research methods are privileged over others in hegemonic understandings of what counts as \"research\" and of what counts as \"knowledge.\" The course examines how gender theory and feminist politics shape the kinds of research questions researchers ask, the types of materials and other information researchers use, and the ways researchers define our relationships with our sources of data, evidence, and other information.

        "description": "This course builds on the new interest in whiteness studies, which assumes that whiteness and masculinity are social constructions rather than \"natural\" identities. Moving from about 1830 to 1925, we will explore the development of a deeply contested discourse of \"national manhood\" in the United States, as it emerges in historically specific circumstances. How does whiteness intersect with related discourses of gender, sexuality, and social class? Beginning with the apocalyptic poetry and prose of Edgar Allan Poe, we will examine terrorized whiteness as an identifying feature of normative masculinity in the works of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Henry James, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Do these authors claim the power to resist threats to their individual autonomy? To what extent do they experience masculine self-reliance as a myth? How do they imagine meaningful communities? Addressing these social issues and related aesthetic questions, we will venture, as Whitman says, \"in paths untrodden.\" Students will write three papers of increasing complexity and there will be shorter writing assignments as well. Class attendance and active participation are required, naturally! Satisfies the Nineteenth Century requirement.",

Through engagement with key works of feminist theory, political manifestos, and creative works of resistance, we will explore how transnational feminist alliances and coalitions have contested and responded to gendered and racialized forms of exploitation, navigating and reshaping territorial and social boundaries. We will engage with debates around the notion of a \"global sisterhood\"; tensions between universal and local feminist practice; the role of difference, nationality and culture in navigating the possibility of solidarity; the role of the Internet in forging cross-border alliances; human rights-based activism; \"women's\" work; transgender inclusivity and transfeminisms. Part of our goal will be to ask how feminist theories from diverse geographical locations have influenced the politics of borders, movements for environmental justice, migrations and mobility, resistance to imperialism and the forging of alternative economies. We will also explore the gray areas existing in between binaries such as feminist/anti-feminist; local/global; home/away; global South/North; victim/agent; domination/dependency. Finally, we will ask how processes of knowledge-production take shape within different intellectual and political movements such as post-colonial feminism, decolonial and indigenous feminism, liberal and radical feminism, Marxist feminism and religiously-based feminisms.",

        "description": "Although women of premodern China have often been portrayed as little more than long-suffering victims of male patriarchy and sexual repression, their lives were far more complicated, diverse, and interesting.  Women played roles as filial daughters, dutiful wives, and devoted mothers, but also as proud courtesans, clever entrepreneurs, educated scholars and teachers, independent nuns, fierce warriors and even powerful rulers.  In this course we will begin with a broad overview of the ideal traditional roles for women established in early China. We will then move on to a general exploration of some of the ways women were represented in classical literature by male writers. Our main focus, however, will be on how, over time, more and more women took up the brush and began to write themselves. In so doing they were able to express their own subjectivity and often radically reinscribe many of the notions of femininity and of female roles that were dominant during their times.  We will conclude with a discussion of ways in which traditional women writers both anticipated and contributed to the 20th century transition to modernity. Most of our class discussion will be based on primary sources in English translation, supplemented by occasional secondary critical scholarly articles where relevant. Prerequisite: Some background in premodern Chinese literature history or culture would be helpful but is not required.",

It uses classical texts of the western tradition to investigate the question of justice and to develop arguable claims through the careful analysis of evidence. The act of crafting arguments, we will assume, is implicated in the question of justice because arguments depend on an ethics of persuasion. We will learn how to practice such an ethics as we improve our ability to understand and utilize four crucial aspects of academic writing: evidence, analysis, argument, and research. Mastering these aspects will make us proficient in the difficult art of judgment. It will allow us to make sense of some of the most powerful literary statements about justice, from \"Antigone\" to \"Crime and Punishment,\" from Shakespeare to Toni Morrison.

This class will examine the complexities of identity as they have been expressed in a wide variety of modern literary (and some philosophical) writings, in order to develop the advanced reading, writing, and research skills that students need in a university setting.  In investigating how people have come to narrate who they are, we will learn about the rhetorical strategies through which their stories are advanced, disputed, and, ideally, accepted.  In our examination of identity, we will focus on mastering the crucial aspects of academic writing - evidence, analysis, argument, and research - and how these aspects can help you articulate who you are and where you're coming from.",

But what is our role within this visual culture? Are we passive spectators or active participants? How does our personal, social, or cultural situation shape what and how we see and experience the world? Throughout this course, students will explore these (and other) questions by drawing from a wide range of discourse communities and genres, including (but not limited to) art history, psychology, sociology, cultural studies, memoir, nonfiction, and creative writing. Readings and assignments are designed to enhance students' awareness of the relationship between writing and their observations and experiences of the visual world. Essay assignments will enable students to explore the visual world and their personal interest in related subjects (such as art, film, social media, and advertising). The course includes one personal essay, two expository essays, and one argumentative essay, as well as peer review workshops, oral presentation, and revision. Additionally, students will prepare for essay assignments by generating ideas and experimenting with form and style through a series of in-class writing exercises.",

How do we make our voices heard?  How can we invent and present compelling written discourse.  \nThis course will introduce students to common rhetorical principles and to the disciplinary history of rhetoric and compositional studies.  Assignments in this class include rhetorical exercise in invention and craft, imitations, and varied compositions, ranging from the personal to critical, from the biographical to argumentative.  We will examine rhetorical principles (audience, context, kairos, exigency, ethos, pathos, logos, and so forth) that are employed, for example, not only in literary analysis but in law, politics, education, and science.  We will aim for a mastery of craft and a refinement of thought. Pre-Req: Writing 1.",

We will learn the skills necessary to adapt the framing of our writing to its audience as we think about how we might persuade a judge, a lay client, a community, a committee or other professionals. We will consider the psychological effects of our writing and how we seek to persuade our readers not only with the strength of our reasoning but with the power of our emotional appeal to their particular interests. We will learn how to think and write about the law in a range of circumstances as assignments cover writing for business about implications of laws, reporting about a law for the popular press, investigating a legal issue and explaining a law's ramifications as well as attempting to encourage support for a particular law; this is not, however, a technical legal writing course. Readings will be drawn from statutes and judgments but more commonly from academic, business and popular examples of writing on the interpretation of laws governing topical concerns. Issues to be dealt with may include the extent of police/citizens' rights to protect themselves (so-called Stand Your Ground laws); rights to refuse medical treatment (Cruzan v Director, Missouri Dept of Health); religious groups' rights to discriminate (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act); Open Carry laws (St. Louis Zoo v Smith); immigration proposals such as The Dream Act; reform of mandatory prison sentences.",

They will experience this process as they conceive, develop and execute the first act of a feature-length script.  Writers will create a screenplay story, present an outline for class discussion and analysis,  then craft Act One.  Writers will be encouraged to consult with the instructor at various stages: concept, outline, character and scene development and dialogue execution.  While the students fashion their screenwriting independently, the class will also explore the general elements of THEME, GENRE, and VOICE.  A more specific examination of mechanics, the nuts and bolts of story construction, plotting, pacing, etc. will follow to support the ongoing writing process.  In-class exercises will aid the writer in sharpening skills and discovering new approaches to form and content.  Writers' work will be shared and discussed regularly in class.  Screening of film scenes and sequences will provide students with concrete examples of how dramatic screenwriting evolves once it leaves the writer's hands.",

In its real-life context, writing always interacts with a community, engaging a defined audience to create an intended effect. So writing always pertains to the polis, and thus, writing is inherently political. In this class, we will focus on political writing by writers who are not politicians, that is to say, official experts on the polis. Foregoing public policy memoranda and economic analyses, we will look at how journalists, grassroots organizers, and creative writers have consciously written to intervene in the affairs of their communities despite their outsider status. Using rhetorical insight and logical analysis, we will examine how writers craft works that inspire and move audiences in several genres: essay, polemic, journalism, and satire. Readings will include Marx and Engels's \"Communist Manifesto,\" Audre Lorde's essays on feminism, Hunter Thompson's gonzo journalism, and the satire of Samantha Bee. Student writing will apply our lessons about the interaction of audience and purpose in order to express political opinions as effectively as possible to the appropriate audience.",

The course will be part survey, part workshop. The workshop aspect will entail writing two different works within the genre, chosen from among the various types of critical writing we survey. For the survey aspect, we'll read book reviews to manifestos to book-length poetic-critical hybrids. The goal is not really compare-and-contrasting but rather considering each form within its rhetorical context and seeing what we can learn. We might look at how a single writer handles various subjects, and at how various writers handle a single subject. Writers likely to be read include Susan Howe, James Baldwin, Dave Hickey, Anne Carson, William Carlos Williams, Susan Sontag, James Wood, E. A. Poe, and Viktor Shklovsky. We will definitely read Roland Barthes.",

The intern will also have opportunities to represent the press publicly, including at the annual AWP conference (travel and hotel expenses will be covered), and his or her name will appear on the press's masthead. Interested students should submit a letter of application and CV to Professor Dutton (ddutton@wustl.edu) and Program Director David Schuman (dschuman@wustl.edu) no later than March 15 of the spring semester of their first year.

We'll consider a wide variety of contemporary fiction (as well as some poems and a couple of plays) which can be roughly divided into four groups, two of which primarily appropriate story elements, as well as style and voice--adaptations and inhabitations (if an adaptation lives within and transforms the house of a prior text, an inhabitation perhaps builds or discovers new rooms)--and two of which primarily appropriate actual text and language--condensations (new fictions constructed as radically abridged versions of prior texts) and assemblages.  We'll also consider \"uncreative writing,\" in Kenneth Goldsmith's term; we'll draw connections to appropriation theory and practice in the visual arts; and we'll discuss evolving notions of authorship and personal expression in a contemporary, digital landscape.  Authors will likely include Caroline Bergvall, Kate Bernheimer, Jorge Luis Borges, Angela Carter, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, Lydia Davis, Kate Durbin, Danielle Dutton, Goldsmith, Shelley Jackson, Jonathan Lethem, Jean Rhys, and Tom Stoppard.

Beginning with a thorough discussion of the landscape of the two-page spread, students will complete a short research project based upon a complex illustrated book in the library. Discussion of print production and binding options in industry will be enhanced by a visit to a local offset printer and to Olin Library Special Collections. Students will deepen their skill base in typographic applications, the use of Indesign as a multi-page document tool, a range of imaging techniques offered in the Book Studio, and bookbinding technique, as well as building their design criticism vocabulary. \nThis course is appropriate for juniors in the Communication Design major.",

We will take on an in-depth challenge in the area of health and well-being and work in cross-disciplinary design teams with an external partner organization. Students will gain experience in planning and executing a human centered design process featuring research, ideation, synthesis, concept development, prototypes and a final presentation, which may include visual design, animation, and sound. Students will work in teams to develop several intermediate project deliverables, such as prototypes and sketches. No prior coursework is necessary though experience with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign are helpful.\nNo prerequisites.

We will see that, rather than a translation of reality, representation operates between perception and cognition as a transcription of reality and is thus a powerful instrument in the design and making of architecture.

The course is organized thematically and chronologically into six units, each identifying an issue of architectural concern at a pivotal moment in the past hundred years: Form, Industry, Place, Nature, Language, and Technology. While these themes run through and consolidate a host of historical movements and theoretical positions-such as constructivism, functionalism, regionalism, sustainability, postmodernism, parametricism, etc.-they also identify issues of ongoing concern, situating contemporary problems in a historical frame. Each unit will be anchored in time and place by a single emblematic architectural project, which will serve as a point of departure and guidepost for the discussion. The first lecture of each unit will then concentrate on a cluster of theoretical debates and formal innovations internal to architectural culture, while the second will situate a set of material patterns-industrialization, economic planning, nationalism, globalization, neoliberalism, decolonization, oil crisis, etc.-that exert pressure on architectural practice.

        "description": "The course will focus on digital fabrication tools, techniques and image theory to uncover new methods of producing physical images. Images are built in a myriad of methods including physical media or from data. Physical images, as defined in the context of this seminar, will be transcend a 2D limitation to develop thickness. The increase to 2.5D or 3D opens opportunities to investigate the use of digital fabrication tools to construct images. \nIn particular, the class will focus on the way information technology continues to have a profound effect on the way we perceive our built environment and the way we represent it. The images that surround us are becoming increasingly easy to generate through information technology. Access to technology both in terms of digital design and output affords the opportunity to reconceive the nature of images. Images are developed through analog, digital or hybrid processes. Their generation is a collaborative interaction between intuition and information processes through clearly defined rules. The scientific theoretician, Peter Galison, discusses the tension between intuition and information on the nature of images in the arts and sciences. Images reveal the intricacy of relations and knowledge, but they are simultaneous deceptive because they bypass the mathematics of pure science. The tension in the arts tends to be between the intuitive, interpretive ability of images as representation versus the image as evidence of a computation-based process.  Architectural theoretician Mark Linder talks about how images in architecture are moving away from representations of something else toward a more literal and non-idealized result of a procedure. The image is literally the process of making visible the end result of an operation. Therefore, images are the evidence of the process by which they were generated.\nAs such, the class will develop innovative processes for our digital fabrication equipment to construct images. The projects will develop new methods to use the CNC mill, laser cutters, knife plotter and 3D printer. New tools may need to be developed and built to enable the image fabrication process. In parallel with technological development is material experimentation. Students will be highly encouraged to test new materials to program their behavior and interaction with technology. ",

        "description": "2015 marked the 10- and 20- year anniversaries of two seminal events that have challenged architects' relationships to large scale, complex societal issues: 1) the publishing of the \"S,M,L, XL\" in October 1995 that featured Rem Koolhaas' manifesto of \"Bigness;\" and, 2) the landfall of Hurricane Katrina just outside of New Orleans in August 2005 that catapulted fields of design into an unprecedented post-disaster context. Students will reconcile these two disciplinary jolts by understanding these seemingly incongruous snapshots of history as jumping off points for new modes for architectural activism and opportunism. Students will design a manifesto, in newspaper format, for a future-based discipline of architecture that sails uncharted realms that are \"Way Beyond Bigness.\" This will require the simultaneous submersion and assertion of architecture within other disciplines; the formulation of alternate modes of representations for emerging practice-based models; the blurring of academic and professional agendas in the urgency of activism; and, the integration of multiple scales, interest groups and agendas in ridiculously complex and antagonistic situations. Underpinning Bigness and Hurricane Katrina will be additional case studies, guest lectures and field trips that cover: CIAM and the emergence of urban design; Koolhaas' thesis and OMA's early practice; mega-scale urban renewal projects in St. Louis; contemporary investigations into territorial scales of design; and, multiple scales of contemporary, integrated Water-based designs, post-Katrina efforts and beyond. \n\nThis course fulfills the History/Theory Case Studies elective requirement.",

This emphasis on the suitability of building modeling for analytical purposes and on the interpretation of such data will provide the basic knowledge necessary for the second phase of this course, in which students will use a previous or current studio project for an in-depth study of their building's performance in the context of its chosen site.  Exploring the interaction between the simulated environment (climate, isolation) and the virtual building with its physical characteristics (materials, assemblies, passive design strategies, heat transfer, daylighting, embedded energy), we will attempt to confirm and test the principles of sustainable design at the schematic level of project development.  The model analyzed by each team will provide sufficient comparative information for a design approach whose desired goal is carbon neutrality in the lifecycle of the building.  Students will be encouraged to investigate the suitability of analytical modeling software, in the context of critical design methodology.  Prerequisites for this course are a basic understanding of BIM methodology and insight into sustainable design practices.",

We will learn how conscious imagination and coherent interventions lead us to ideal realities.\n\nThis class examines the design and construction process as academic research. We consider the practice of making architecture as a synthesis of analysis, interpretation and transformation. Studies will teach us how a building idea influences its construction and how the knowledge about construction can become the starting-point of an idea. \n\nInterrogating design problems and investigating existing typologies as a methodology will lead us to specific answers. We will explore conceptual-artist practices and examine their strategies, learning to lead with intent, play with parameters and question the givens. \n\nFrom there, we will look at examples of Swiss Architecture whose early integration of construction in the design process has a long tradition. One could say, that the bearing itself gets designed in Switzerland. We will consider invisible structures and material specificity. Learning this language gives us the ability to transform our ideas into specific architectural expressions and precisely tailored solutions. \n\nThe form of the seminar is experimental. We consider our meetings to be spatial and contextual interventions, precisely designed like architecture. Sessions will vary, from a lecture to an exhibition, talks, a dinner- the goal is to be very conscious about what we are doing. This process is going to be documented through the whole semester. Each student will create his own design thesis and realize an installation that reflects it. The results will be exhibited and presented to the public.",

In an attempt to tell the story of modern architecture from the Argentine capital, the first question deals with the relationship between urban culture and modernization.  As the first Latin American metropolis, Buenos Aires rapidly became a laboratory for a myriad of urban and architectural ideas.  In this process, however, the expansion remained faithful to certain urban typologies derived from the Mediterranean world.  Addressing this particular tension, the course concentrates on the urban evolution of Buenos Aires in a period that extends from 1870 to 2000, examining the changing relationship between buildings and urban tissue.  The second question refers to the role played by South America in the architectural scene between 1930 and 1960, a period in which the subcontinent became an experimentation field for architectural modernism, especially in connection with the ideas of Le Corbusier.  This part of the course will then offer the opportunity to study the work of relevant architects of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.  Getting to know the buildings designed by Amancio Williams, Eladio Dieste, Oscar Neimeyer and Clorindo Testa will allow us to discover an agenda of problems and possibilities associated with the emergence of modernism, which, in turn, contributed to the consolidation of cultural identities throughout the region.

Landscapes to be engaged include the roadsides of Route 66, the ruins of Detroit, abandoned St. Louis cemeteries, Appalachian coal mining areas, the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, Houston's petrochemical facilities and more. We will examine ideas and methods proposed by geographers, artists, theorists and historians. Fieldwork will take students to sites in and around St. Louis related to course readings, including a cemetery, a landfill, a mound and the historically African-American Ville neighborhood.

        "description": "This seminar will investigate the contested edge between the Mississippi River and the adjacent occupied land - between development and commerce based on our human needs and desires and a river indifferent to our presence. Over one hundred years ago, Twain warned us about the futility of our attempts to control the volatile Mississippi River: \"Ten thousand River Commissions .cannot tame that lawless stream, cannot curb or confine it, cannot say to it, Go here or Go there, and make it obey.\" For reasons of river navigation, irrigation, hydropower, and flood protection, the river has been dammed, straightened, deepened, and segregated from its natural floodplain.  These massive engineering feats have caused severe and perhaps irreparable ecological damage by upsetting natural flooding cycles, disrupting flows, draining wetlands, and inundating habitats.  The results, while temporarily beneficial to some communities, are the progressive intensification of floods and the destruction of riparian zones.  \nTraditional static infrastructures will continue to play a necessary role but cannot adequately handle increased floods and droughts resulting from global warming and our own intransigence. Rather than continually building harder and higher to protect communities from high waters, knowing from experience that the wild Mississippi will continually topple our efforts, this seminar will explore gentler, smoother transitions between land and water, city and river.  Looking toward a more resilient condition, we will explore this ecological crisis as an opportunity for constructing a more livable, coupled, edge as a continuum between river and settlement - one requiring us to bend, accommodate, refrain, and think more creatively and strategically. The work of the seminar will be to create both a River Manual and to initiate an interactive web Repository of data, strategies, maps, history, river city coupling examples, focused on the Mississippi River at the St. Louis region.  Students will contribute with research, mapping, graphic design, and web construction. This course fulfills the History/Theory Case Studies elective requirement.",

The discovery and observation of the many local ways of doing and thinking will take place through observation of the urban landscape and the appreciation of concrete works by local architects.  Activities will be focused on critical observation of the urban context and architecture, including the development of graphic exploration instruments and techniques.  The relation between the observer and the observed will be intensified through graphic exploration.  In this way, the seminar will purposefully avoid published written criticism as a way to approach the cases and bodies of work to be studied.  This will be in order to construct a vision more closely attached to the practice of design and the confrontation with concrete design issues and less 'contaminated' by pre-established historical or theoretical interpretation.  The choice of case studies coincides with the array of buildings to be visited in field trips in Buenos Aires, Brazil, and Uruguay.  Buildings and practices to be 'observed' will represent different scales, different degrees of intervention and the construction of different landscapes.  The seminar is based in three class settings:  site visits, professor and guest lectures, and in class presentations and discussion.  Rather than a cold, systematized, technical instruction on graphics, the development of personal observation/drawing tools and techniques is stressed.  This includes sketching on the site and redrawing assignments based on personal sketches.",

The disciplines from which this course will draw upon will include urban planning, architecture, geography, urban sociology and anthropology.  The scope of this course is intentionally broad and diverse as it aims to reflect the multitude of factors that are involved in urban phenomena.  Some of the themes that will be examined include:  the Spanish and Portuguese Colonial City; planned cities in the nineteenth century (the case of La Plata); modernization in Latin America; modernism and planned cities in the twentieth century (the case of Brasilia); the 'favelas' in Brasil and 'villas miseria' in Argentina; postmodernism and globalization in urban studies; urban fragmentation in the contemporary metropolis (using the cases of Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires), and the debate on the sustainable urban form.

The social and economic upheaval experienced in inner city neighborhoods and underserved communities over the last half century are the result of government and social services having withered in a period marked by dramatic social, demographic and technological changes effectively restructuring the US economy.  These issues may seem unrelated to the practice of architecture and urban design, however they are fundamental to how design shapes community.  At this moment we are challenged as design professionals with the opportunity to engage and serve communities that have been marginalized by conventional modes of thinking and creative practice.  \nThe seminar builds upon existing relationships and a body work and engagement in the Pagedale community while laying the ground work for new action.  This seminar questions traditional modes of practice and common assumptions through focusing creative production to confront the challenges facing residents and decision- makers. The course seeks to break down physical and disciplinary boundaries to achieve a radical new production.

Disturbance can take many forms, and the phenomena that are subject to disturbance are many and varied. Landscapes are continually disturbed by social, economic, and physical irruptions, but cognitive structures, perceptual frameworks and cultural values are also subject to turbulence that, as with landscape disturbance, often leads to innovation, novelty and resilience.\n\nThe course will explain what emergence theory is, where it comes from, how it relates to environmental design in general, and how it has - or could - change the way we design human and nonhuman inhabitations. Through readings, presentations and discussions, students will be able to connect the rise of emergence theory in cultures of contemporary thought to its application in practice. \n\nThe main theme of the course is the potential for emergence theory to enable us to relate qualitatively different modes of existence (human; nonhuman) to each other and through the connections thus established improve the lifeworlds of all. \n\nThe structure of the course is based around ten key concepts of emergence, as follows: open systems, situation, initial conditions, assemblage, nature cultures, difference, field theories, disturbance, morphogenesis, formless.\n\nEach student will investigate one of these concepts and present their findings to the class.",

        "description": "The Urban Issues Symposium is an interdisciplinary course open to students in architecture, law, business, urban design, social work, public health and public policy. Students and faculty from Washington University and Saint Louis University work in interdisciplinary teams to respond to projects in collaboration with local partners in the St. Louis region.  During class, faculty members and subject experts present on multi-disciplinary aspects of development projects to help guide the work of class teams.\n\nSuccessful project deliverables require a holistic understanding of and engagement with the community, private property owners, various government agencies (e.g. streets and bikeways, economic development, planning design and use, housing), businesses, schools, and other relevant organizations and individuals.  Components of the team response might include community participation, tax credit financing and other subsidies, collaborative planning, social capital building, design, land use, social services, environmental issues, and public-private partnerships. Interdisciplinary student teams are expected to meet regularly outside of class to discuss and prepare their team deliverable. \n\nIn previous years, collaborative teams have tackled relevant challenges associated with developing and sustaining trail systems within the urban fabric of St. Louis as well as developing conceptual comprehensive strategic plans for the Spanish Lake community.  In the upcoming Fall, the faculty will offer another case specific urban issue for the student teams to address, and ultimately submitting group solutions to stakeholders.\n\nFor any additional information, please contact Barbara Levin at blevin@wustl.edu.\nThis course fulfills the Urban Issues or MUD Track elective requirement.",

        "description": "This seminar will research the morphology & the morphogenesis of the Informal City as it evolves to be an integral phenomenon of global urbanism, and the corresponding economic, social, architectural and urban theory.  Today, one billion people live in informal cities (36% of the world's population) and this is expected to grow another one billion over the next 30 years.  As it is currently evolving, the informal city is an urban phenomenon set up within the planned city's territory and increasingly an integral part of it -- often comprising up to 75% of the city and one of the elements of urban morphology that shapes city design.  Thus, it is no longer possible to accept a concept of the informal city that centered on negative parameters (ghettos/slums/poverty/crime, etc.), but there is a need to find sustainable spatial solutions to integrate these settlements into the \"formal\" urban/architectural tissue leading to the dissolution of urban and symbolic boundaries between the \"informal\" areas and \"formal\" districts.  To this end, the course will review various architecture and urban strategies and projects of informal urbanism in Asia, Africa and South America supported with an optional field trip to South America favelas/barrios in order to define a place of action for architects and urbanists in the informal city.

It will provide students with an introduction to the design and planning of American cities in the context of this country's democratic tradition, its multi-cultural society, and the particular morphology of its urban areas. Contemporary American cities have urbanized in unprecedented and distinctive ways that suggest the creation of a unique urban culture, despite the seeming globalization of urban trends, or the apparent universalization of urban forms.  Identifying the role design can play in this culture requires a lucid appraisal of the context in which metropolitan development takes place.  Four study modules will introduce basic issues in planning law, real estate finance, urban economics and environmental planning through lectures and research projects, as well the presentation of Metropolitan St. Louis development case studies by professional and political leaders.\nMUD students have priority.

This is not a technical skills class; we won't be learning how to restore windows or masonry. The class incorporates many guest speakers whose varied careers touch on a wide variety of preservation issues and the ways they are addressed in the real world. Students will hear from developers, architects, lawyers, historians, archivists, politicians, City administrators and community activists in order to obtain a broad perspective on the diverse ways that people work to protect and revitalize historic buildings and neighborhoods.  Students will be responsible for weekly readings and related class discussions. Field trips will include bus tours of preservation issues in St. Louis, a walking tour of Downtown, and a visit to one or more local historic sites. In some cases, students will be responsible for their own transportation. The major class project will be a comprehensive plan for a historic rehabilitation/adaptive reuse of a real endangered building.  Plans will draw upon class experience and involve historic research, site visits, an analysis of applicable ordinances, laws, incentives, and an assessment of current building and market conditions. It will culminate with a creative, realistic and sensitive proposal for adaptive reuse that incorporates skills from other components of the architecture (or related) curriculum.
